## Note on the Text

The text of *Rigby's Romance* presented here was transcribed from the editor's personal copy of the Angus and Robertson edition (1946). The physical copy was scanned to PDF and OCR performed using a version of ABBYY Fine Reader. The text has undergone three rounds of checking, including a final oral collation using a recording of John Derum's reading of the novel.

The 1946 Angus and Robertson edition was set from files of the Broken Hill *Barrier Truth* weekly newspaper. These were provided by Joseph Furphy's literary executor Kate Baker and they are now held in the Sydney Mitchell Library. A complete run of the serial in its original context can be found at the National Library of Australia. A <a href="http://juxtacommons.org/shares/8WskwU" target="_blank">textual comparison</a> between this text and the original fifth chapter of *Such is Life* was produced via Juxta Commons. This comparison view indicates the changes Joseph Furphy made as the text of *Rigby's Romance* evolved from its original context as a chapter of *Such is Life* to become a separate work.

Whilst conveying my own unobtrusive individuality into
Echuca on a pleasant evening in the April of '84, I had
little thought of the delicate web of heart history which
would be unfolded for my edification on the morrow. My
mind was running rather upon the desirableness of a whole
bag of chaff for my two horses; a satisfying feed for my
kangaroo dog (which is implying more than most people
wot of); and a good sleep for myself. I would have been
prepared to aver that I was merely bound for Yarrawonga,
via Echuca, on business of my own; whereas the 
smoothly-running Order of Things had already told me off as 
eye-witness and chronicler of a touching interlude -- a love 
passage such as can befall only once in that one life which is
each person's scanty dividend at the hand of Time.

Making straight for my customary place of sojourn --
namely, Mrs Ferguson's Coffee Palace -- I helped the 
land-lady's husband to unsaddle and feed my horses; after
which, I caused that unassuming bondman to bring about
twenty pounds of scraps for Pup, whilst I chained him
(Pup, of course) in an empty stall. Then, with six or eight
words of explanation and apology to Mrs Ferguson, I
sought my usual bedroom, and shedding all my garments
but one, threw myself into collision with that article of
furniture which has proved fatal to some better men, and
to a great many worse.

Here an opportune intermission of about ten hours in <pb n="xviii"/>
the march of events affords convenience for explaining the
purpose of my journey to Yarrawonga. The fact is that
I object to being regarded as a mere romancist, or even as a
dead-head spectator, or dilettante reporter, of the drama
of life. You must take me as a hard-working and ordinary
actor on this great stage of fools; but one who, 
nevertheless, finds a wholesome recreation in observing the parts
played by his fellow-hypocrites. (The Greek *hupokrisis*,
I find, signifies, indifferently, "actor" and "hypocrite".)

I was booked for one of those soft things that sometimes
light on us as gratefully and as unaccountably as the wholesale 
rain from heaven upon the mallee beneath. John C.
Spooner, Rory O'Halloran and I had just bought the
Goolumbulla brand. Or rather, the manager, Mr Spanker,
had given us the clearing of the run under certain 
conditions, one of which was the payment of £100.

Goolumbulla -- centrally-situated in that wilderness 
between the Willandra and the Darling -- had been settled for
about five years. Six hundred head of cattle had originally
been placed on the run, to the disgust and exasperation of
Mr Spanker, whose bigoted faith in the evil-smelling
merino admitted no toleration for any other kind of stock.
His antipathy was reasonable enough in this instance, for
these were warrigals, even as scrub-bred cattle go. You
know the class -- long-bodied, clean-flanked, hard-muscled,
ardent-eyed, and always in the same advanced-store 
condition. They had been wild enough when first brought
from the ranges of the Upper Lachlan, and Goolumbulla
was just the sort of country to accelerate their reversion
to the pre-domesticated type. At the time I speak of, they
could barely endure the sight of a man on horseback. As
for a man on foot, they would face anything else on earth
to get away from him; and if they couldn't get away, that
man might either betake himself to his faith, or stand on
guard. Which latter alternative sounds so dishonestly vague
and non-committal that literary self-respect demands a
slight digression.

To deal with fear-maddened cattle in confined spaces -- <pb n="xix"/>
as in drafting or trucking -- the infantry man requires an
alert eye, a cool head, and a suitable stem of scrub, 
terminating in a nasty spray of leafless twigs; also his flank
and rear must be covered, in order to confine the enemy
to a frontal assault. These conditions being fulfilled, the
operator can reserve his mortal preparation for some future
emergency, though it would, perhaps, be as well to abstain
from anything in the nature of language until the draft is
put through. A handy piece of brush, judicially presented,
will check the charge of any steer. The animal will try to
get round the obstruction, but he won't attempt to break
through.

Here, by the way, I may seize an opportunity of further
disturbing the congested ignorance of the bookish public
by noticing Sir Walter Scott's misapprehension of the
bovine temperament, as displayed in *The Lady of the
Lake*. You remember how the milk-white bull -- "choicest
of the prey we had, when swept our merry men Gallangad"
-- is depicted as fiery-eyed, fierce, tameless and fleet, to
begin with.


- {:.indent-3}But steep and flinty was the road,
- {:.indent-3}And sharp the hurrying pikemen's goad;
- {:.indent-3}And when we came to Dennan's Row,
- {:.indent-3}A child might scatheless stroke his brow.
{:.poetry}

Stockmen will conclude either that the child would be
an accomplished matador in disguise, or that Scotch cattle
have some peculiar way of reasoning out a new situation.

Nor did the Goolumbulla brand entertain any Scottish
idea respecting the advantageousness of southward 
emigration. A draft, started for Victoria, was like a legion of
evil spirits evicted from their haunt. As they went through
dry places, seeking rest and finding none, the frenzy of
nostalgia, or home-sickness, aggravated by chronic 
insomnia, made them harder to hold than quicksilver. Their
camp was liable to spontaneous eruption at any hour of
the night; and then it would be as easy to steady a cyclone
as to ring the scattered torrent which swept incoherently<pb n="xx"/>
through the scrub, like a charge of duck-shot through a
wire fence. 

Drovers of superhuman ability and profane address had
at different times taken away three drafts; but none of
these professors had ever besieged the station for a second
contract. Indeed, the last drover, though as vigilant, as
energetic, and as prayerful as any on the track, had found
himself with about forty head left out of two hundred by
the time he had crossed the first fifty miles. His horses 
being completely played out in limiting the leakage even to
this proportion, he had sacked his three or four men, and
had sullenly escorted the remnant of his draft back to
their beloved wilderness. The absconders found their way
home in batches, franked by the boundary men of 
intervening paddocks, who willingly made apertures in their
fences to speed the parting guests.

But now Goolumbulla had changed owners; and the
new firm had authorised Mr Spanker to get rid of the
cattle sediment at any price, and stock up with sheep.

One of the Goolumbulla boundary riders was an old
friend of mine. This Rory O'Halloran -- better known as
Dan O'Connell -- was a married man. By nature dreamy,
sensitive, and affectionate, the poor fellow had a few
months previously sustained a blow which left him in a
trance of misery. His only child -- a fine little girl five or
six years old -- had got lost in the scrub and had been found
too late. Rory had settled down patiently and submissively
to his routine work again, but the memories and associations
of his home, though precious while the sense of 
bereavement was fresh, had in time become intolerable. For such
afflictions as his there is no nepenthe, and the only palliative
is strenuous action.

Hence Rory's nature, recoiling in unconscious 
self-defence from the congealing desolation of Memory, craved
such hardship and distraction as would be limited only by
physical endurance. And instinctively perceiving that the
Goolumbulla cattle were quite competent to meet his
requirements, he had talked the matter over with Mr<pb n="xxi"/>
Spanker, and provisionally engaged to buy the brand for
£100. He proposed me as an associate. Spanker, in 
seconding the motion, suggested John C. Spooner, professional
drover, as a third co-operator. Seconded, in turn, by Rory,
and carried on the voices. The station stock-keeper had
then been approached on the subject, but he washed his
hands of the whole business. He darkly predicted calamity
to the enterprise and insolvency to the station, as a 
consequence of such "blanky, flamin', jump-up greed for a bit
of wool".

Then followed hasty and copious correspondence 
between Rory, Spooner, and myself. Everything went 
without a hitch. The preliminaries were soon arranged. For my
own part, not being blessed by Nature with the saving
grace of thrift ("saving grace" is good), I had no cash
reserve. Spooner was in a similar state of sin, for, in spite
of his almost insulting efficiency, he was constitutionally
unfortunate. But Rory had about £300 in the bank at Hay,
and he was prepared to finance the undertaking.

The arrangement was this: Spanker was to enclose with
a strong wire fence each tank from which the cattle were
accustomed to drink, leaving the lower wire high enough
to admit sheep. An open gateway would be left in each
fence until everything was ready. Then the gaps would be
closed, and the cattle, shut out from water, would hang
round the tanks, tailed and humored by our party, till
the whole brand was collected. Meanwhile, the three of us
would jointly sign a bond for the £100 -- which, by the way,
was merely a nominal price for the draft, and immediately
make a start. The poor dumb beasts would certainly be
thirsty to begin with, but this was nothing when you 
consider how much worse they would be by the time they
reached the next available water.

No one had any clear notion of how many head might
be collected, but we counted on something over 400 -- 
possibly up to 550, including calves and cleanskins. We
intended to take them across the Murray, and dispose of<pb n="xxii"/>
them in handy lots at the agricultural fairs in northern
Victoria, thus passing the trouble on a little farther.

But this was prospective. For the present, it had been
arranged that Rory should meet Spooner and me at Hay,
on the next Sunday but one. Another week would take
the three of us to Goolumbulla, with three or four hired
men, and ten or twelve decent horses. Then, if we could
not command success, we could do more, Sempronius,
we would deserve it.

Again, we might fairly count upon favorable conditions.
The route was familiar to Spooner and myself; there would
be no disturbing moonlight for the first week or so; and
we might expect reasonably cool weather. The trip to the
Victorian border would be only about 350 miles. So
everything was propitious.

My own immediate business was to be at Yarrawonga
on a certain day, there to take delivery of three horses,
already purchased by Spooner, with Rory's money; then
I had to turn up at Hay on the Sunday above referred to.
Meanwhile, Spooner, with a few more horses, would be
converging from his native town of Wagga.
Of course, these details have nothing to do with my
record; they are presented merely as a spontaneous 
evidence and guarantee of that fidelity to fact which I acquired
early in life, per medium of an old stirrup leather, kept for
the purpose.

{:.poetry}

Just as a bale of wool is dumped, by hydraulic pressure,
to less than half its normal size, I scientifically compressed
something like twenty-four hours' sleep into the interval
between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. Then a touch of what you call
dyspepsia, and I call laziness, kept me debating with 
myself for another swift-running hour. So it was getting on
for nine o'clock when I sat down to breakfast with Mrs
Ferguson, the two servant girls, and the husband already
glanced at. All the boarders had by this time dispersed
for the forenoon.

However, scene and association presently recalled former
companionship; and I varied the usual breakfast-table gossip
by asking:

"Have you seen the Colonel lately, Mrs Ferguson?"

"Not since a fortnight after the last time you were
here; it's nine weeks today, and the other'll be seven weeks
come Friday. There were two ladies here inquiring for
him yesterday afternoon. One of them had a dark marone,
and a sailor hat trimmed with the same colour; and the
other had the new shade of brown, and a new tuscan with
three black feathers. They wanted to know his address."

"Badly, no doubt. Had they little Johnny with them?"

"Go way. Well, I had just re-posted two letters that
had come. They were both office envelopes; one of them <pb n="2"/>
was from Waghorn Brothers, who he was with three or
four years ago fixing up them wire binders, and the other
was from the agent he's with now. Most likely they want
him again."

"Quite likely they do."

"That'll be it, then. But I wonder what they wanted
him for. They were both strangers to me, and when they
found I knew Mr Rigby so well, I got them to come in
and sit down in the front room in the cool. They were
very quiet-mannered and nice-spoken (I don't care what
you say). They said they might call again before they
left, and the one with the brown dress gave me her card.
What did you do with it, Louisa?"

"Annie had it after me."

"It's gone," said Annie laconically. "That card-basket's
piled up; and I s'pose it got blown on the floor. Anyhow,
I found Bibblims sitting under the front room table, 
eating it."

Bibblims was the baby.

"Do you remember what the name was?" asked Mrs
Ferguson.

"It's on the tip of my tongue," replied Annie. 
"Something like 'Tasmania'."

"'Tasma'?" I suggested, incredulously.

"No," replied the girl, "it was a long name."

"And where is Rigby now?" I asked.

"Why, he's at Yooringa, of course," replied Mrs
Ferguson. "Maginnis (late Waterton), Farmers' Arms,
Yooringa."

"Just a nice stage for me today," I remarked; "and
there's sure to be grass in Cameron's Bend. I'm going to
Yarrawonga, and I'll take this side of the river. What is
Rigby doing now? I thought he was running the vertical
at Hawkins' mill."

"Only till they got properly going," replied the inspired
woman. "He's taking pictures and writing for them 
American people now. He got started nine weeks ago. It's for a
big book, all in volumes, on farming, and dairying, and <pb n="3"/>
vines, and fruit trees, and one thing or another, in different
parts of the world. They've kept him on a string longer than
they'd keep me, anyway. It's five months ago since he was
engaged, and not so much as 'thanky' till he got orders
to start in a hurry. It was the American Consul who 
recommended him; and well he might, for there's very few things
that would take Mr Rigby at a short."

"I'll be pretty sure to meet him at Waterton's, then?"

"Maginnis (late Waterton), Farmers' Arms, Yooringa.
He'll be there today; and he won't be leaving till next
Monday at the inside."

"Well, I think I'll be going now, Mrs Ferguson. I'll just
settle up with you, so as not to keep the horses saddled."

"Oh, Ferguson'll saddle them." That unobtrusive but
useful person hastily finished his coffee and glided from
the room. "Just rest yourself while you can. I'm afraid
you'll have a dusty day for travelling," etc. etc. And so
the frivolous conversation went on till I shook hands with
the three women, gave the two children a threepenny bit
each, wrung Mr Ferguson's hand in silent condolence, and
took the track.

As I rode eastward across the town, followed by my
packhorse and kangaroo dog, the postman intercepted me.

"Morning, Collins. Jefferson Rigby's a friend of yours,
ain't he? Any idea where he is?"

"Up the river, I believe -- so Mrs Ferguson tells me. I
expect to see him tonight."

"Couple of ladies came to the post-office yesterday 
hunting him up. We sent them to Mrs Ferguson. So they'll be
right. Horses looking a bit hairy on it."

"Season's telling on them."

"Grand dog."

"Middling."

"So long."

"So long."

{:.poetry}

I went on, following the road up the river. I had cantered
a mile, or better, and was hardening my horses with a long
walk, when a buggy and pair overtook and passed me.
Though grappling at the time with an exceedingly subtle
metaphysical problem, I casually noticed that the driver
was a boy of sixteen or seventeen wool seasons, and that
there were two women in the buggy: a thinnish one sitting
beside the boy, and a fatter one on the back seat, each
sheltering herself from the blazing sun with her umbrella.
The buggy went on its way.

My next spell of cantering took me past the vehicle, and
my next spell of walking brought the vehicle past me again.
This occurred time after time; it occurred till I was sick
of it; and when we had left Echuca twenty miles behind, it
was occurring worse than ever. I had tried putting on more
pace, and I had tried slacking off, but each expedient
seemed equally to aggravate the evil, though the buggy
horses kept up the same slow, uniform, slinging trot. Other
travellers overtook and passed us, and were as though
they had not been. We overtook and passed others, who
similarly sunk into oblivion. But we couldn't get rid of
one another. Each time we passed I looked sternly ahead,
and the women occulted their faces with their umbrellas,
for the thing was becoming intolerable. I felt as if I were <pb n="5"/>
dogging them with some sinister purpose, and they 
obviously felt like people driven by the mere stress of 
circumstances into immodest conspicuousness.

My whole day's journey was thirty-odd miles, and I had
intended doing it in one stage, but now altered my plan
on account of that buggy. On reaching a place where the
track branched, to unite about a mile ahead, I watched the
boy diverge to the left, then I quietly dodged off to the
right. Half a mile further on I stopped, pulled the 
pack-saddle off Bunyip, and tied both horses in a good shade.
Then I spent half an hour in carefully dredging Pup all
over with insecticide, and another half-hour in the 
interminable work of carving a stockwhip handle. Having thus
given the other party a fair start I resumed my way.

Passing the intersection of the tracks a few minutes later
I saw the buggy standing in the shade of a tree, the boy
taking the nosebags off the horses and the women putting
things under the seats. They had been stopping for lunch,
probably with a view to getting rid of me. Then I 
perceived that there must be something in it, and so resolved
to let things take their course. I have seen too much of
life to persist in shafting against destiny.

Still looking haughtily ahead, I passed at a walk within
three yards of the party. The boy was now in his post of
honor, keeping the buggy on the off lock. One of the
women was taking her place beside him, while the other
stood by, holding both umbrellas; then the latter climbed
into the back seat. I had opportunity to notice that the
first woman was tall, straight, and symmetrical, though
rather spare than slight; and that her hair was of a glossy,
changeable brown. The other showed large and Juno-like,
black-haired, fairly handsome, but by no means young; and
I was further privileged to observe that a good deal of her
had been turned down over the anvil.

By the foot, American, thought I, as my politely 
restricted arc of vision left the party behind -- and you'll see
by-and-by how infallible this rule is. In fact, the foot of
the American woman is a badge as distinctive as the <pb n="6"/> 
moustache of the Australienne. However, there was a good
expression in the foot now under notice; it was a generous,
loyal, judicious foot, yet replete with idealism and 
soulfulness; wherefore, I became at once prepossessed in favor
of the owner.

In a few minutes the buggy overtook me for about the
fifteenth time, and the boy pulled up to the walking pace
of my horses.

"Say, boss," he inquired, "do you know where Maginnis'
Farmers' Arms is, if it's a fair question?"

"Yes, straight ahead."

"How fur?"

"Twelve or fifteen miles. That's where I'm bound for."

"Grand dog you got there."

"Fair."

"Not a bad style o' moke you're ridin'."

"Decent. He does me for poking about."

"Could you tell us what kind of place this hotel is?"
asked the light-brown hair. "Are the people likely to have
accommodation for us tonight?"

"Well, to tell you the truth, ma'am," I replied, "the house
was nothing to boast of in Waterton's time. Grog business,
pure and simple. The hotel itself would be no disgrace to
Echuca; but the management, as I knew it, was not good;
it was but so-so; and so-so is not good, it is but so-so. I
trust it may be better now, though there are more 
promising names than Maginnis. I think I'd as soon chance
Flanagan."

Both women smiled amusedly, but a perturbed 
expression soon gathered on the face of the brown-haired one.
Whilst replying to her question, I had taken note of
thoughtful, pure-grey eyes, a faultless nose (which is 
saying a lot), and a mouth of ideal perfection; altogether, a
face of more than common beauty, but of such exceeding
loveliness as to disarm criticism. A face with a history, so I
immediately snap-shotted it on a blank spot in my memory,
with a view to working out the biography at some future <pb n="7"/>
time. I could get her name from the boy in the evening, and
no other factor would be required.

Close ahead of us was a farm-house on the right-hand
side of the road. A few full-grown cattle were in the 
stock-yard; the portly agriculturist was there himself, ordering
some boys about; and a long-legged, slow-moving man,
with a Robinson-Crusoe beard, was arranging a 
roping-pole. A bright chestnut horse, saddled and bridled, was
hitched to the fence close by. It is easy to be mistaken in
the identity of a man, but the horse is always a certainty.

"I'll likely overtake you again in a few minutes," said I
to the boy, as I turned Cleopatra, and crossed the road to
the fence. "At it again, Steve?" I called out. Steve laid
down the roping-pole, and mounted his horse to ride the
fifty yards.

"You gave me a start," said he, as we shook hands across
the fence. "I'm busy now; but you had better stop with us
tonight. We're camped in Cameron's Bend, down from
Waterton's pub. Dixon's with me. I've bought a pair of
steers from this cove, and we're going to couple them now,
and let them civilise themselves in his paddock for a day
or two. Save any chance of them sulking in yoke."

"Well, I won't keep you, Steve. Did you see Jeff Rigby
at Waterton's?"

"No. Haven't seen him for five or six seasons."

"Well, we'll be able to hold a meeting tonight, with the
Major in the chair. Now go back to your vile occupation."

When I overtook the buggy again, I was as jocund as a
seeker after wisdom may permit himself to be.

"An old school mate of mine," I remarked graciously,
as the three looked round toward me. "Steve Thompson.
I've known him since we were each about as high as that
middle rail. One of the straightest men in the country --
though he's supposed to have a curse on him through a
dubious transaction of ten or twelve years ago. He was
owing fifty notes to a man that got lost in a shipwreck on
the coast of New Zealand, and Steve failed to chase his
friend with the money till the whole transaction adjusted <pb n="8"/>
itself at that, leaving a sedimentary curse on Steve. I had
little thought of meeting him today -- thought he was a
couple of hundred miles north. I was looking forward to
meeting another very old friend, Jeff Rigby, a striking 
contrast to Thompson in many ways; the most conspicuous
point about him being that he allows nobody to know 
anything except what he tells." The sentence seemed to die
out to nothing; partly because it was impossible to finish
the last clause without a solecism, but more particularly
because I noticed both women's eyes fixed on my face, with
a disconcerting interest in the casual gossip. It is 
humiliating when you feel yourself expected to say something
good, and a swift reconnaissance of the subject shows you
no opening for anything beyond what a nobleman might
drivel. Moreover, I was fresh from the pastoral regions,
where etiquette demands frank, unsolicited, and copious
comment on the merits or demerits of some absent person;
whereas, these women were evidently civilised, and 
consequently regarded my conventional remarks as the exordium
of some good anecdote. I therefore gave my earnest 
attention for a few moments to a mare and a foal, standing in
the shade of a tree close by.

## CHAPTER III


- A still, sweet, placid, moonlight face,

"Pardon my question," said the brown hair hesitatingly.
She paused a moment, then asked: "What countryman is
your friend?"

"Australian, madam; born near Geelong. His parents are
English."

"Are you sure?" she faltered, while the color faded from
her face.

"Perfectly sure, madam. I'm as certain of his nationality
as of my own."

Then twenty or thirty seconds heaped twenty or thirty
years on that girl's head. I hadn't noticed the faint wrinkles
about her eyes till now, but, riding close to her, and 
looking at her with puzzled sympathy, I marked not only these
footprints of the crows of Time, but here and there a
silver thread imparting unsought dignity to the beauty of
her sun-bright hair. And lapsing into my deplorable Hamlet
mood I began to calculate her age.

Ay, poor post-meridian! Under the searching analysis of
some mental confluent, the beauty was dissolving from
her face, yet leaving the loveliness intact. Enhanced,
heightened rather, by unspoken kinship in liability to the
tyranny of Time -- that pathetic kinship which, clothed in
poet's words, carries more tenderness than any other touch
of nature. There is one grace of the rosebud; another grace
of the expanded blossom; and, to the enlightened mind, a <pb n="10"/>
more adorable grace in the fading flower, which gains in
fragrance as it loses in freshness.

When we liken women to glass -- as we often do -- the
parallel rests on fragility, on restorableness, on 
refractiveness, or some such property. But there is a more touching
similitude yet. Of all known glass the most lovely is a 
collection exhumed some forty years ago at Idalium in Cyprus.
Science becomes Poetry in mere contemplation of these
relics. Take some excerpts from a description in Knight's
*Dictionary of Mechanics*: "Tints, positively outside of all
experience, confuse the most accurate observation . . .
marbled with hues like those of incandescence . . . sending
light, pearly hints of variegated radiance from elusive
depths fantastically pied with scales of iridescence on
strong original coloration . . . defeating all sense of strict
estimation and cheating the mind with the notion of a
possible perfection . . . as if Turner had painted skies on
them in his maddest mood and had been allowed to use
flames for colors . . . The general effect seems to suggest
that all the sunsets that have glimmered over Cyprus since
those vessels were lost in the earth had sunk into their 
hiding-place and permeated their substance," etc. etc.

*The glass is perishing*. Matchless, indescribable, inimitable
is its beauty, yet it is a loveliness that comes only with
decline, a passive response to the first tender touch of that
inexorable hand which brings man and all his works to
dust.

I wish I could stay to moralise on this, because our
appreciation of women is a subject that seems to invite
disentanglement and exposition. But knowing my own
proneness to wander aside, plucking fruits of philosophy, I
shall, for once, guard against digression and confine myself
to clean-cut narrative.

Two widely-divergent views of woman are illustrated --
one in "The Gowden Locks of Anna" by Burns, the other
in Moore's exquisite paraphrase of St Jerome "Who is the
Maid?" The former paints the inherent sex-charm of
Creation's fairest type; the latter pictures her attained  <pb n="11"/>
sex-value. The former conveys passion; the latter, adoration.
The former sees femininity; the latter, womanhood. And
these are the two extremes.

The relative potency of these diverse influences depends,
of course, upon the receptivity, sensuous or psychical, of
the person subjected to their agency, yet it is worthy of
note that, where controlling masculine minds are moved or
biased by sex-influence, the force is exercised by a woman,
not by a female. And not till the peach-bloom of youth is
gone can the woman dominate the female and her 
personality reach its maximum angel-loveliness or its most 
formidable devil-beauty. None but Kadijah, fifteen years his senior,
could captivate the stormy soul of the Arabian prophet.
Also, if the mature Josephine Beauharnais had cared for
the Faubourg St Antoine as she cared for the Faubourg St
Germain, Bonaparte might have been the brightest name in
modern history; but we know in which direction her
strong allurement led, and we know how he followed it to
perdition. These instances, though multiplied by ten
figures, could prove nothing; nevertheless, they exemplify
how the world is swayed by women, not by females. And
each man, be he king or beggar, is a little world of his own.
If he be swayed by a female, as kings and beggars 
frequently are, he is an extremely little world.

But don't misapprehend me as identifying or 
confounding femininity with youth, and womanhood with 
maturity. Just as many a man, having outlived the boy's 
enthusiasm and ingenuousness, retains the boy's uselessness
and self-conceit, so, in the other sex, mere femininity too
often accompanies maturity. When this occurs -- in fact,
when the case is one of incorrigible femininity -- the subject
is good for two things only: to suckle fools and chronicle
small beer.

"I beg your pardon, sir," said the deliberate voice of the
woman on the back seat, "were you speaking of Mr Rigby,
or of the other gentleman?"

"I was speaking of Thompson, madam. Rigby is an
American. He came out here -- let's see -- just when Donolly <pb n="12"/>
broke out; and our acquaintance began immediately after.
Of the many friends he has made, my father, I think, holds
priority in date, and I take precedence in intimacy."

My reply was, of course, addressed to the black hair,
who had asked the question. Glancing then at the other,
and perceiving that she had renewed her youth like the
eagles, I thought to while away a few minutes by 
remarking, in my dry way, that Echuca was just then in a state of
hungry curiosity touching two ladies who had been 
making inquiries after the very person under discussion.

"Speaking of Rigby," said I, "it was only this morning
that I was a little amused by" -- here, with a sudden flash of
intuition, I loosely and tentatively identified my auditors
with the mysterious scouts; whereupon, figuratively 
speaking, I flogged my tongue unmercifully, then gave it its
head, and heard it continue in the same breath -- 
"remembering what a hero he seemed to me in the days when earth
was young. I like to consider myself a Melchisedec in
philosophy; but the conviction is often forced upon me
that, in many ways, I have been a mere disciple of the
Colonel's. In fact, we differ only on points where he's
grimly and disagreeably right, and I'm comfortably
wrong. I wouldn't take £100 a year and be as conscientious
as he is. For instance, I'm a Conservative; and he is -- well,
not to mince matters, he's a State Socialist. In other words,
I adapt myself to the times and the seasons, whilst he thinks
the conformity ought to be on the other side." Rather
disconnected, and altogether rudely confidential, but not
bad for a desperate impromptu. And the women, refined as
they evidently were, listened as to the voice of a clergyman.
"What is Mr Rigby's occupation?" asked the black hair,
after a short silence.

"Second-rate photographer and descriptive writer, at
present, madam. He has been a first-rate engine-driver, also
mechanical expert, a third-rate journalist, and a fourth-rate
builder. At various times he has ranked high up to ninth
and tenth rate in something like a score of other and more
menial occupations; but speaking with actuarial precision,<pb n="13"/>
he's a land surveyor. If there's any question of his identity,
I may add that he was born at a place called Marathon,
somewhere in the backblocks of New York State."

There was intense interest in the face of the 
brown-haired woman as I spoke, and evident relief as I concluded.
Then another pause.

"This is a most happy coincidence," said she, with a
frankness almost supplicatory. "Mr Rigby and I were born
less than five miles apart, and I knew him in America up to
the time of his departure. Is -- is he much altered since you
knew him?"

"A good deal, madam. The second twenty-five years of
a man's life covers about two of the Seven Ages. In this
instance, they have transformed the lover, sighing like
she-oak, to the mature egotist, full of wise fads and modern
theories; but it would take an able reasoner to convince the
Colonel that he has in any way altered for the worse.
Physically, he's as strong as ever he was; he attributes this
to his Puritan descent -- I attribute it to my climate. For
more than twenty years I have piously looked forward
to the privilege of gracing him with the Earl of Morton's
tribute to John Knox: 'There lies one who never feared the
face of man.' But waiting is weary work, and hope deferred
maketh the heart grizzle. He'll probably see me out. I fancy
he'll be like Moses at one hundred and twenty, his eye not
dim, nor his natural force abated. He differs significantly
from Moses, however, in respect of not being by any
means meek above all men on the earth."

A subdued smile played over the face of the 
brown-haired woman, leaving her eyes soft as velvet.

"He hasn't been successful?" she conjectured, almost
timidly.

"Only in asserting himself, madam. Financially, he's a
failure -- like myself."

"He has served in your military forces?" she next 
suggested, with tacit apology in her voice.

I softened my negative down to a forbearing shake of <pb n="14"/>
the head, then perceiving a certain feminine deduction in
the foolish surmise, I replied:

"You refer to the title of Colonel? The fact is that when
I first knew him he seemed such an ideal Down-Easter
that to deny him a title of some kind -- military, naval, civil,
or ecclesiastical, as the case might be -- was to take from him
that which not enriched me and left him poor indeed. The
whole thing is merely a spontaneous concession to his
nationality, carrying neither flattery nor sarcasm."

"Is he married?" asked the black hair casually.

"Oh, no," I replied. "So far from it that the incongruity
of the idea amuses me."

"A woman-hater, I assume," she persisted with uneasy
boldness.

"Anything but that," I replied. "His demeanor toward
women is partly paternal and partly reverential and partly
oblivious. I have always compared him with the earlier
Benedick -- one woman was fair, yet he was well; another
was wise, yet he was well; another was virtuous, yet he
was well; and if all graces had come into one woman, he
would have congratulated that woman and passed on well
pleased for her sake. I never met anyone else like him in
this respect, but knowing him as I do, his insusceptibility
appears to me full of interest. I feel quite certain that it is
owing to an early dis" -- I checked myself barely in time,
gave my tongue another flagellation, and heard it go on in
its usual garrulous way -- "cipleship of Epictetus, which has
colored his whole life, endowing him with a form of 
selfishness that puts other people's generosity to shame."

I was in magnificent form and knew it, yet felt like a
denizen of some cold country walking on thin, creaking ice.
Who were these women with their reluctant forwardness
and their wistful desire -- tacitly expressed in tone and 
manner -- to conciliate a mere passer-by, one whose character
they could only conjecture, and of whose very name they
were ignorant? Modest and cultivated they certainly were,
but battling in some way with feminine inadequacy, the
black hair struggling to carry off anxiety under cover of <pb n="15"/>
grave self-possession, the brown hair wilting under a 
helplessness so shrinkingly sensitive, and so sympathetically
communicable that, stranger as I was, I could mentally feel
her clinging to me with the mute entreaty of an ownerless
dog. How did such people get through life? What business
had they here? Why their interest in Rigby? Were they
always like this?

"But pardon me, ladies," I resumed. "I ought to tell you
that my name is Collins. In occupation, I change 
involuntarily, like the chameleon, according to my surroundings.
At present, I must stigmatise myself as a cattle drover. I'll
feel very much honored if you avail yourselves of any 
information or assistance that it may be in my power to
give."

Whilst I was wondering whether this sounded courtly
or impertinent, the brown hair bowed acknowledgment
and, taking out her card case, replied with easy grace,

"Indeed, Mr Collins, we appreciate your courtesy -- Miss
Artemisia Flanagan." I remembered my own rash 
witticism of a few minutes before and raised my wideawake
with extra solemnity. "I feel myself relying upon you
already," she continued, handing me her card.

During the next minute I was a broken reed for 
anybody to rely upon. A good gust of wind would have
toppled me off the saddle. To explain this seizure, it will
be necessary to glance back along that rugged track which
might have been travelled with something like comfort and
profit if I had personally inherited from my forefathers a
moiety of their solid experience instead of the whole sum
of their crude natural propensities.

## CHAPTER IV


- I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
- Could not, with all their quantity of love,

- {:.indent-6}*Hamlet*, Act V, Scene i.
{:.poetry}

On a summer morning, twenty-three years prior to this
encounter, a Victorian ratepayer sent one of the arrows
out of his quiver to muster some cows on the common,
eight or ten miles from home. In the seclusion of the
ranges this missile gathered as much wattle gum as he could
eat; then leaving his horse to feed about with the saddle
on, he lay down in the shade, and became immersed in a
work of blood-and-thunder fiction, which his foresight
had provided. After reading himself stupid, he took a swim
in an adjacent water-hole, then basked in the sun for an
hour, and finally dedicated his attention to a likely-looking
place, where the age-abraded apex of a small rise showed
abundance of shattered and weather-beaten quartz. This
was his style of mustering cows.

Spare your scorn. The cloth-yard shaft left that rise
with three specimens in his possession -- one, showing a
couple of colours; another, carrying a three-grain piece;
and the third, a good half-penny-weight. Wearily returning
home in the deepening twilight, our projectile reported
the lack of success which had attended his exertions in
mustering, and casually produced the specimens, which
latter he had happened to notice on hastily dismounting to
tighten his girth.

The ratepayer, being a man for whom digging had no
fascination, just dropped a line to a young friend of
opposite bent, then working a half-wages stringer on
Pleasant Creek. A fortnight afterward, the digger arrived. <pb n="17"/>
A day or two more found the genial ratepayer, the 
enthusiastic digger, and the simple-minded arrow, on the
spot where the latter had dismounted to tighten his girth -- 
a spot known for years after as the Yankee Reef, and
always more distinguished for promise than for fulfilment,
even before the stone petered out into hungry leaders.

These details are merely introductory to the information
I received from Rigby on the night we camped at the reef.
We were lying, each wrapped in a blanket, around the
smouldering fire. I was supposed to be asleep; in fact, I
had been asleep till the sudden cry of a curlew roused me,
and I found it worth my while to remain awake. For the
accessories of the situation -- soft summer moonlight, bush
solitude, and one sympathetic auditor, had melted the
Major's habitual reserve, and he was relating to my dad, in
tones hoarse with emotion, the tragedy of his life. I muttered
something in my sleep and rolled slowly over, face 
upper-most -- a post hard to surpass in auricular advantages.

I soon discovered that a direful and ineffaceable quarrel
with the girl of his choice had broken the poor 
Commodore's moorings, and left him rudderless, dismasted, derelict,
at the mercy of wind and tide, and without the heart to
rig anything jury. His sole consolation was in the certainty
that his wrecker in ruthlessly working this havoc had
marooned herself. She would never marry. She *couldn't*.
He knew her loyal, lofty nature.

Here he stirred my depths with twenty minutes of steady
panegyric, to the general effect that Miss Vanderdecken
was beautiful, accomplished, gifted, amiable, beyond 
anything that imagination could body forth, or poet's pen turn
to shape. Wherefore it warmed the very sickness of his
heart to dwell on the misery she must be enduring. It was
entirely her own fault. She was petulant and quarrelsome,
frivolous and heartless, and the best thing that had ever
happened to him was this quarrel, inasmuch as it had swept
away all tawdry romance from his life, and laid bare its
grand realities.

In describing this quarrel he was bitterly precise; yet I <pb n="18"/>
experienced disappointment, even injury, in failing to
detect any blame attachable to the other party, whilst my
dad's judicial mind could find no cause of 
misunderstanding whatsoever. But the Colonel quoted Byron, Tennyson
and other excellent authorities, falling back at last on the
solid though irrelevant fact that he had loved Kate too
well, and it was her own sterling worthiness of that devotion
which barbed the arrow that rankled in his heart. Then,
again, the holy hush of Satanic tranquillity (I can find no
better expression) came, angel-winged, over the martyr's
tempest-tossed soul, as he imaged the girl's irremediable
despair.

Henceforward, however, their ways lay apart, and
neither would ever know the other's fate. For the very
short time that might elapse before he should shake the
yoke of inauspicious stars from his world-wearied flesh,
and the wattle blossom should wave above his lonely 
resting place, he would try to do as much good and as little
harm as possible. He owed this to Kate's memory. Poor
Kate! Her heroes were always the men who voluntarily
sacrificed themselves for a principle. So it must be; for
now all length was torture; since the torch was out, lie
down and stray no further.

He had hardened himself in honor. Not one of his early
friends knew whither he had drifted. He had no family
obligations. His nearest relations were his step-mother and
her children; and they were only too glad to see him out
of the way. His sole tie to life was Kate, and when she
was gone, chaos was come again.

He had looked back once, to see her standing in the
doorway, with the snow-flakes falling on her head. When
would that picture fade? Never! -- till it dissolved with all
earthly things. She was nineteen then, and he was 
twenty-five; she would be twenty-one now, poor Kate, and he
was twenty-seven in years, but more than fifty in the iron
stoicism which is bought only with blighted hopes.

And so on. Of course, I am only giving you an epitome.
Yet this lugubrious ass was the sagacious, energetic, and <pb n="19"/>
self-reliant young citizen of the day before and the day
after.

However, as twelve-year-old arrows of Australian 
manufacture don't notice or understand the discourse of their
elders, this disclosure gave me something to ponder over in
my own unsophisticated way; and thenceforward the
Colonel appeared to me as one clothed in iambics, and
spondees, and dactyls, and all manner of poetry. As years
went on, my garnered knowledge of his life-absorbing 
infatuation provided a satisfactory key to his altruism, 
integrity, and cynicism; and whenever the conversation of
my adult associates tended to show that, in love as well as
in other things, there was nothing but roguery to be found
in villainous man, I had only to remember the Senator, and
keep on believing.

I utilised him as an object lesson in fidelity. Though
voluntarily abiding under the limitations of chronic poverty
utterly fatal to your ideas of romance, he fulfilled my 
conception of Azim, in *Lalla Rookh*; and it became my custom,
whenever I saw him fall into reverie, to place myself, so to
speak, in rapport, and thus enjoy a second-hand gloat upon
the picture which I had learned to conjure up at a moment's
notice -- pine forests, wolves, and wigwams in the 
background; apple-trees, maize and pumpkins in the middle 
distance; and in the foreground, half-veiled by falling 
snow-flakes, the figure of a beautiful, though somewhat 
mynheer-looking, sheaf of contradictions, standing in a doorway, and
gazing out into the gelid desolation, whilst unavailing
remorse, like a grub in the quondong, fed on her damask
cheek.

In poetic keeping with his desolated life, the Judge ever
afterward maintained perfect reticence respecting the 
unhappy stroke that his youth suffered. I have always been
willing to acquire information and would therefore have
welcomed his confidence at any time; but as he chose to
keep the burden to himself, I had to let him carry it the
best way he could, contenting myself with the scrap I had <pb n="20"/>
picked up, and remembering that all things come to him
who philosophises.

At last the potato was cooked. That cryptic passage of
the Deacon's history found its Rosetta stone in the card
presented by the brown-haired woman, for the name
thereon was "Miss Kate Vanderdecken". Also, the fate
which had so sternly insisted on a conference between us
was satisfactorily accounted for. Nomenology -- the science
by which we deduce the person from the name, or the
name from the person -- was a little out, to be sure; but you
can no more secure absolute precision in that science than
in any other. Things will occasionally happen of themselves.

The boy, perceiving the progress of our acquaintance, now
threw out a suggestion:

"I say, miss, if this bloke's goin' to the same place as
us, I wouldn't mind lettin' him take a spell o' drivin', and
I'll ride. He needn't be frightened o' these yarramans. I got
them like lambs."

"I have no objection, Sam. It rests with Mr Collins.
But don't imagine that we're tired of your company."

"I don't suppose you are," replied Sam, "but I want a
smoke; an' I got too much manners to stink your clo'es
with tobacker. I'd a had a whiff when we stopped, on'y like
a fool I forgot my matches in the hurry this mornin'. Wo,
chaps! Hold the reins for one minit, miss." We altered the
stirrups to his length, and he mounted: "Now your matches,
Collins."

"Do you want a pipe?" I asked.

"Let's see your pipe. *That!* No thanks! I got everything
but matches. Well, we're right now. You go on ahead.
Never mind me." Then the buggy horses resumed their
steady trot, leaving Sam in the rear.

It was some minutes before the mutual constraint of
passengers and driver wore off. The former -- as I knew by
my gift of intuition -- were wondering whether I couldn't
afford a new pair of boots. The latter -- a poor arithmetician
at best -- was adding twenty-five to nineteen over and over
again, but without being able to get the same result twice
running. <pb n="22"/>

But a reciprocal effort brought our gossiping apparatus
into working order. It was a novel experience, to feel these
educated and evidently exclusive women meekly 
endeavouring to stand well in my estimation. It seemed so like a
restoration of the true Order of Things that I had 
temporary respite from the haunting consciousness of my 
entanglement with a Riverina lady, who, in the slangy sense
of the word, was too good for me. (But that is another
romance.)

Rigby being our point of contact, the conversation leaned
chiefly in his direction; and the women did most of the
listening. Yet when a genial tact impelled either of them to
contribute something, there was interest, as well as 
grammar, in what she said. I was not surprised to learn that, until
four or five months previously, no one in Rigby's native
region knew definitely the place of his self-exile. But Miss
Flanagan's brother held some position in the publishing firm
whose Melbourne agent had employed the prodigal; hence
she had incidentally heard his name.

Miss Flanagan was a perfect stranger to the Colonel
personally, though she knew his step-brothers and their
families. The girls had been under her tuition a few months
back. She was a teacher of mathematics, algebra and other
inviting sciences in a ladies' seminary, and she and Miss
Vanderdecken had been closely intimate for many years.
She had taken a twelve months' holiday; and now the
two were seeing what was to be seen in this right-hand
lower section of the Eastern Hemisphere.

Each woman, in her own way, was profitable to me in
spite of the prior soul-mortgage unhappily covering my
moral securities, but, owing to a twenty-three years' 
contemplation of the snow-scape already described, my 
sympathy centred on Miss Vanderdecken. And though I had
too much innate delicacy to go blurting out the General's
nocturnal confidences to my pa, I felt deeply impressed
by the concurrence which was bringing these two people
together so felicitously, yet so involuntarily, after such
long separation. At the time of that angry parting in the <pb n="23"/>
land of ague and dried apples the odds would have seemed
a hundred millions to one against a purely fortuitous 
conjunction at the Farmers' Arms, Yooringa; nevertheless,
this was coming to pass. Their lines of life must have been
insensibly converging ever since, and yet the slightest
dislocation in the tendency of events at any time during
twenty-five years -- one misfitting link in the chain of
circumstances -- and the parting would have held good for
ever. Now I would make it my business to see that the
connection was not missed at the last moment.

Meanwhile, Sam was bearing up wonderfully under his
voluntary exile from the buggy. Each time either of us
overtook the other, he threw out a word of tempered
approval touching Cleopatra's paces; but these interviews
were carefully guarded against when any other traveller,
or any roadside habitation, was in sight. Such precious
opportunities of letting his light shine before the public
were never wasted. For two full hours it was vouchsafed
to him to avail himself of a peerless kangaroo dog and a
loose pack-horse, not to speak of the daisy he was riding,
and he worked his accepted time for the last copper it
was worth, to the end that those who ran might read -- 
might unmistakably read him as a saddle-weary alien, fresh
from the remotest skirts of civilisation; one who could
give fearsome accounts of waterless country, whose only
property was just what you see and whose sole consolation
was his pipe.

Presently, a slight angle in the road brought into view
the Farmers' Arms, two or three miles ahead, and I pointed
out the building to my passengers. From this time Miss
Vanderdecken never spoke except in monosyllables, and
though she was evidently on her mettle for firmness,
there was something in her manner of breathing which
made me wish I had given more attention to that branch
of pathognomy which deals with the possible eccentricities
of women who haven't seen their lovers for a quarter of a
century. Miss Flanagan also looked perturbed, and I
noticed that she was holding Miss Vanderdecken's hand. <pb n="24"/>
So I monologued with a fluent tongue and a speculative
mind while we neared the pub, and drew up to a walk.

"Ah, there's the Colonel himself," said I, in an 
undertone, as we passed the house.

"No," whispered Miss Vanderdecken, with agony in
her face, "there must be some mistake." And she averted
her eyes from the figure of a bloated and sottish-looking,
though decently dressed, old buffer who had just emerged
from the bar door, and was slowly seating himself on the
form in the verandah.

"In the parlor," said I. "You can see him through the
window. I think he's reading a letter."

All her self-restraint could not repress something like a
sob, as her eye fell on the severely handsome profile of her
countryman, framed by the open window. I drove on a
few paces, and stopped at the gate of the yard. It seemed
manifest that the women were leaving everything to me.

"Now, ladies," said I, "if this place is anything like
what it was six months ago, you'll have to go on to the
Royal, which is a traditionally respectable house, five or
six miles ahead. In that case, I'll send Rigby with you; but
I trust that I may feel justified in making arrangements
for you here. Sam, just hook the horse on the fence, and
take these reins."

"Thank you, Mr Collins," murmured Miss Flanagan.
"You're placing us under many obligations."

"Pray don't mention our arrival to Mr Rigby just yet,"
added Miss Vanderdecken, in a quivering voice.

"I'll merely prospect the place. And let me repeat that if
you fail to avail yourselves of my further services, I must
take it as a slight."

Both women bowed, without speaking. I entered the
house, introduced myself to the bright young landlady,
and saw at a glance that the government was much 
improved since Waterton's time. After making the necessary
arrangements, I returned to the buggy, and Sam drove into
the yard.

With the air of a Castilian noble, I assisted Miss<pb n="25"/>
Vanderdecken from the buggy, roughly averaging her at about
one hundred and fourteen pounds, chiefly bones. 
Meanwhile, Miss Flanagan had disembarked herself. The 
landlady received them with overflowing respect, and led the
way into the house, while I followed, carrying two 
portmanteaux.

I had placed the luggage in the passage, and was 
wondering what was the proper thing to do next, when Miss
Vanderdecken, with a gesture of polite deprecation,
stepped past the landlady, and detained me by a glance.
The pathos in her appealing eyes and paled lips was
heightened by the seven hours' deposit of dust on her
features -- nothing being clean about her but the whites of
her eyes.

"I have no scruple in adding to my indebtedness, you
see, Mr Collins," said she, in a barely articulate voice, "but
I should like to speak to your friend while I am here.
And -- you know -- the lapse of time seems to make strangers
of most intimate friends. Might I ask you to introduce
me to him, formally -- as his countrywoman -- not yet --
presently."

"Indeed, Miss Vanderdecken, apart from the pleasure
of meeting your wishes, I shall be delighted to confer such
a happiness on the Senator. A message from you at any
time will find me in the parlor." And so I withdrew.

After relieving Bunyip of his load, I sought out the
Major, and went into the bar with him to purchase the
freedom of the house, inviting the shocking example out
on the verandah to join us in a drink. The old gentleman,
of course, took a long-sleever, looking with ostentatious
pity at the Doctor's sarsaparilla and my Chateau Tabilk.

"You goot helt, yentlemence," said the moral beacon,
dipping his heavy, ashen moustache in the froth. "Peer
vor der Yarmance, unt Yarmany vor der peer," he 
continued, setting down the pewter pot. "Minezelluf, I schall
pe ver podiclo mit mine trinks. Ven der Yarmance knog
(sheol) der Vrench mit dot last var, he vas pe der peer
unt der nettle-gon, unt der vine unt der chassepot. Vat
derplatty (sheol)? Eh?"

"Very true, Fritz," observed Rigby.

"Well, I be (penalised) to (sheol)," remarked a deep
voice, in mechanical forecast; and a captivating aroma of
serene iniquity seemed to be wafted in on our company,
as the lithe figure, and handsome, sunburnt face of Dixon,
the bullock driver, appeared at the door. He shook hands
cordially with me. "Come, what'll you have, chaps? Mine's
a meejum shandy."

The Colonel and I had a good excuse for declining. Fritz
drained his pint with alacrity.

"Minezelluf, I vill you helt trink mit von long peer.
Peer vor der Yarmance, unt Yarmany vor --"<pb n="27"/>


"Any letters for Robert Dixon or Stephen Thompson,
boss?" interrupted the bullock driver.

"I'll see in half a minute," replied the young landlord,
as he served the two drinks.

"Unt Yarmany vor der peer," pursued the Teuton.
"Minezelluf, I schall pe ver podiclo mit mine trinks. Ven
der Yarmance knog (sheol) der Vrench --"

"And you think the beer had something to do with
the result of the Franco-German war?" I suggested hastily,
though civilly.

Fritz set his pint on the counter, and clapped me gently
on the shoulder, while a feeble smile crept over his sodden
features.

"Mine zteb-zon, Yimmy, schall pe der yong man der
par mit," he remarked with more dignity than relevancy.

"Can't suffer these (adj.) foreigners, no road, Rigby,"
observed Dixon, calmly indicating Fritz with a backward
jerk of his thumb. "Nobody should be allowed in the
(adj.) country only Europeans, like me an' you. Ain't it
aggravatin' to hear the gibberage these fellers comes out
with? Wonder why the (adj. sheol) they never learn to
yabber grammatical?"

"Minezelluf, ass der nettif moch petter ve schall der
platty Angleech zpeag," retorted Fritz sternly. 
"Penegoot; volang-villeen; assylum-soss-yetty; der goot-villeen
soss-yetty. Eh? Dot knog you into der gocked hat."

"You're a scholar, Fritz," said I politely.

"Mine vrent," replied the translator, again laying his
hand on my shoulder, "der Yarmance vos off Got pe der
man high rise mit. Vot vos you glory Gveen? Von 
Yarmance. Vot vos you nople Brince? Von Yarmance. 
Minezelluf, I schall von Yarmance pe, unt brout mit. Eh?"

But Fritz's countercheck quarrelsome had not passed
unmarked by Dixon. The bullock driver had listened with
amused interest, as to the winsome prattle of a child; and
his eye still dwelt benevolently on the German whilst the
latter spoke to me. Then, after a deferential pause, Dixon <pb n="28"/>
removed his pipe from his mouth with a delicate movement
of wrist and fingers, and suavely turned to the Colonel.

*Parturiunt montes nascitur ridiculus* (adj.) *>mus*" he
observed in a compassionate tone, and with faultless 
precision of accent. "Same time, it shows the feller's got a sort
o' dim idear o' things. Quite common to see this (adj.)
cravin' for a bit o' knowledge among the *profanum* (adj.)
*vulgus<*. Comes sort o' hard on a pore (individual) to feel
his self no better'n a *vox et praeterea* (adj.) *nihil*, as the
sayin' is. Don't it strike you that way, Rigby?"

"No letters for Dixon; one for Thompson; forwarded
from Hay; fourpence to pay on it," said the landlord, as
he re-entered the bar and handed a letter to Dixon.

"Well, I'll be (adv.) well toddling," said the bullock
driver, with magnificent apathy, when he had settled the
liability. "You'll stop with us, Collins? Straight down the
(adj.) fence."

"Right, Dixon, I saw Thompson today coupling his
steers."

"Dot Domson, he cash der platty riffer dees mornin'
got-vish von dirty-boundher, he tell me der vrog mit,"
said Fritz, rallying from his discomfiture, yet looking
beseechingly at Dixon, who leant languidly against the
doorpost contemplating a magpie on the fence at the other
side of the road.

"What become of her?" asked Dixon indulgently,
though still finding more interest in the magpie than in
Fritz.

"Pag vonce more yomp mit der pank, plop, unt to
(sheol) go," replied the German, pressing eagerly into the
good graces of this fencer to the Sophy.

A critical situation for Dixon. If he gave ready credence
to the news, he would at best place himself in the position
of a man receiving information; at worst he would be the
victim of a sell. If he threw doubt on a statement which
would probably prove to be true, his own dignity would
be trailed in the dust. If he didn't reply at all he would
be open to the imputation of not knowing a thing that <pb n="29"/>
Fritz knew and being too dirty-flash to ask. A splendid
and careless magnanimity was the true policy here.

"Didn't hear nothing about it," he replied, with a 
generous but futile effort to share the childish solicitude which,
by cruel contrast with his own indifference, was eating
into Fritz's dignity. "But then, Thompson cleared off
middlin' early, an' I turned out middlin' late. Anyhow, I
ain't surprised; the (adj.) river's fallin' like (sheol)." And
relapsing into his lethargy, he sauntered away.

"Well," said Rigby to me as we left the bar, "my 
wagonette is down beside the wagons. Get your horses ready,
and we'll follow Dixon and cast our lines in the river,
too."

"In the river of Time, Colonel?" said I dreamily. "Our
lines are cast therein already, foolish one; and our business
is to -- Oh, *now* I know what you mean! But you should
either qualify your river by its distinguishing adjective or
call it by its strikingly appropriate name -- for 'murrey'
means dark red. If the people who frequent its banks don't
know its proper title, I wonder who does; and they never
speak of it loosely and indefinitely as 'the river'; they
always call it the crimson river. Please bear this in mind,
Major. It's the king of Australian rivers, and I naturally feel
a little nettled to hear it shorn of its title. However, we're
not going yet. Come into the parlor. There's a surprise
in store for you. I providentially met an acquaintance of
yours today -- Miss Kate Vanderdecken. She knows you
well, and has been the whole afternoon looking forward
to meeting you. She's here now, taking her ease in her inn
 -- the only way in which she resembles Sir John. She
intends to stay all night; so I suppose you won't be down
at the Red River till late."

"Ah! What did you say her name was?"

"Miss Kate Vanderdecken. Here's her card. She comes
from your own blizzard-smitten land, and the unerring
law of Happenology -- the very law that moulds marbles <pb n="31"/>
to a spherical shape and controls the apparent vagaries of
our planetary system -- has landed her here, to give you an
evening momentous enough to date from. How is that for
lofty?"

"You bewilder me, Tom."

"I expected nothing less, Sheriff. By the way, there's
another lady with her -- Miss Artemisia Flanagan, and a
calculator by profession as well as by nationality. Hence
I'm glad to see you so clean and presentable, though, to
do you justice, I knew your habits, and was under no
apprehension. I'm as proud of you as if you were one of
my own. Turn round, till I see if there's any grass-seed,
or horse-hair, or whitewash on your back. No, you're
humanly perfect; you would pass for a married man of
the upper middle classes. You know a married woman
always keeps her old impostor trim and tidy, even to the
inner ply of apparel, so that in case of him getting killed
off a horse, or in a railway accident, there will be no 
damaging discredit reflected upon the widow."

"I feel like a man in a dream, Tom," said Rigby, 
absently. "You haven't told me how you came to --"

"Mr Collins," said the slow, soft voice of Miss Flanagan,
who paused in the doorway, then glided into the room,
acknowledging the Deacon's presence by a slight bow and
a penetrating glance.

I introduced the two Down-Easters, and at the end of
three minutes' desultory conversation perceived that
Rigby was weighed in the balance and found genuine. Such
is the inconceivable despatch of feminine judgment.

Then Miss Flanagan led us to the private parlor, where,
with a couple of nicely-turned phrases, which I had
rapidly concocted and committed to memory, I 
presented the long-severed friends to each other. Miss 
Vanderdecken, exquisitely lovely in a simple dress of creamy
white, betrayed no trace of her former agitation. Her face,
always sweet and engaging, was now transfigured, glorified,
by the emotions of womanhood at its best; and, indeed,
I never saw Rigby appear to such advantage as under the <pb n="32"/>
inspiration of her presence. Of course, there was no crash,
nor was there any embarrassment on either side, nothing
but a graceful interchange of courtesies and polite 
solicitude, and presently the Senator, according to his custom,
settled down into the leading part. Still I could detect,
under the grave tenderness of his manner, a certain 
abstraction, easily accounted for as things stood.

I remained only five or ten minutes. Then promising to
call on my new friends in the morning as I went past, I
retired with some ceremony, readily pardonable when you
consider everything. I had furnished the epilogue to a
drama of thrilling interest. Alone I did it, and therefore
felt morally and socially uplifted.

Whilst re-saddling Bunyip, I got into conversation with
Sam, who was making friends with Pup, obviously with a
view to his seduction, the latter being no difficult matter
by reason of the strong spiritual affinity always existent
between the boy and the kangaroo dog.

"Fond o' scenery, ain't they?" remarked Sam, as he
passed me the girth from the off side.

"Who?"

"Them shemales I fetched. That's what they come for.
Dashed if I could see any scenery about. I say, which o'
them do you fancy most?"

"Both about equal. Which is your choice?"

"Well, I ain't at liberty. I'm ordered. But I should say
Arty. I like them a good size."

"Which Arty?"

"Miss Flanagan. Her with no feet."

"How far are you going up the river?"

"No furder. Back tomorrow or next day. They jist
hired the buggy for a couple or three days to come on
this fur. My word, they was in luck to git me for takin'
charge of them. Touch-an'-go. Happened to be out o'
work, on account o' my boss havin' to clear, with a 
warrant after him for biggany."

"For what?"

"Biggany. Havin' two wives, both to the fore. Rotten
contract, ain't it? Wheelwright by trade. Me an' him was <pb n="34"/>
gettin' on grand together, only for this bust up. I got
another place to start improver, soon's I git back. 
Wheelwrightin' ain't a bit stinkin' for a trade, is it? Got a few
new idears ripenin' ready for when I git on my own. See,
most o' the wheelwrights is imported beggars; an' they
can't be expected to have the best quality o' brains. Wish
I had that dog."

"What use would he be to you, Sam?"

"Well, a feller must have a dog, an' he may as well have
a kangaroo dog. Where you clearin' off to?"

"Down to the river, to camp with some chaps I know.
Come and have a drink of soft tack before I go."

"Not this time, thanks. We fetched a dozen bottles o'
lemonade, an' each o' the shemales drunk two bottles, an'
you drunk one, an' I polished off the other seven or eight -- 
not to speak of a gorger before we started. That'll do me
today. My inside's all furmentin' now. You could hop a
marble off o' my stummick."

"You'll soon get over that, Sam. So long."

"So long."

The sun was still half-an-hour high when I re-passed
the pub, and turned down the reserve. Half a mile along
the line of fence, and just where the latter ran into the
river, I found the two wagons, and, near them, Rigby's
covered wagonette. By Dixon's directions, I took my horses
across a dry billabong, and, mindful of the escaped 
thirty-pounder, brought a fishing rod back with me. I had hooks
and lines in my swag.

Whilst cutting this rod, I noticed a curious thing. Close
beside me stood the shell-stump of a freshly-felled hollow
tree; and about twenty feet along the prostrate trunk was
a newly-cut aperture that a middling-sized man could
nicely creep through. And straight above the stump, about
twenty feet up in mid-air, was a little stationary dark
cloud easily resolvable into a multitude of bees. The loud,
menacing hum of these sons of toil hinted that they were
by no means in the best of temper. They had come home
from all quarters to find things not merely disarranged, <pb n="35"/>
but vanished entirely, like the early cloud and the 
morning dew. Here a phrenologist would think it strange that
an organ of locality, perfect enough to guide its possessor
through the undiversified air, should be so poorly 
balanced by perceptive and reflective faculties that the
subject, in the first place, couldn't see what had happened,
and, in the second place, couldn't reason out the certainty
that its tree must be somewhere, and that the best way
to find it would be to look for it. But the case appeared
to bear out my theory that we are all specialists. And it
seemed to clash with Lubbock's hypothesis, namely, that
the bee has no intuition of locality, but steers its course
by sight alone. At all events, these bees, being, like myself,
conservative in tendency, were lost for lack of a precedent.
Hard work and no play had tied Jack immovably to the
fine "old moorings", had, in fact, paralysed his reasoning
faculty, and extinguished his initiative, thus making him a
model wealth-producer, and a never-failing text for the
Thrift-homilist.

Yet the lack of this perceptive shingle on the 
thought-dome of a docile wealth-producer sometimes upsets the
calculations of the wise and prudent. For instance, an
intimate friend of mine was a most able and accomplished
theorist. Like Columbus, he was a man with a fad; and
this fad was the common domestic hen. He maintained
that women, owing to a constitutional dearth of enterprise
and understanding, were incompetent to manage these
birds. But, having worked the thing out scientifically in
his own mind, he saw his way to fortune in a flock of
judiciously-crossed Black Spanish and Brahmapootra, 
stiffened by a strain of the Dorking, with, perhaps, a blend
of the Orpington for fertility, and just a suggestion of
the Wyandotte, as a precaution against pip.

Under this impression, he sold out his grocery business
and bought a small farm. Here he supervised the erection
of ten hen-houses, to begin with. Each little edifice was
fitted with nests, ladders, roosts, etc., and was mounted on
four low block-wheels. Next he obtained a supply of hens, <pb n="36"/>
and allotting twenty-four of these unassuming producers
to each caravan, he spent a week in training them to 
consider themselves at home. Then at the dead hour of the
night he hooked a steady old horse to each hen-house in
turn, and distributed them, with their sleeping tenants, over
paddock No. 1. During the ensuing day, the hens, 
spreading out like sheep, fared sumptuously on locusts, grubs,
seeds, etc. and in the evening retired -- not to their houses,
but to the vacant spots from whence those abodes had been
shifted.

There was nothing for it, of course, but to carry each
slumbering imbecile to her proper address -- a work which
occupied half the night -- and this task had to be repeated
every evening for a week. By this time, according to the
system so elaborately worked out, commissariat 
conditions necessitated a removal of the caravans to No. 2 
paddock; and for six or eight nights each former site in No.
1 was pathetically indicated by the globular forms of two
dozen somnolent hens. Nor did this innocent contumacy
admit of any remedy; for the whole physical construction
of the feathered races, particularly their external finish,
clearly indicates that Nature has not designed them to be
cowhided with satisfaction or profit. Anyway, the 
enterprise ended ignominiously; and now, if you want to make
an enemy of that most amiable experimenter, you have only
to introduce the subject of hens.

"Jist set down an' wire in," was Dixon's salute when I
returned to the camp. "Soda bread, an' bacon, an' honey,
*ad* (adj.) *libitum*. Dunno whether you like mustard mixed
up or not. We always eat it dry. Ain't got sich a thing as
a swappin' book on you, I s'pose?" he continued, as we
settled down to the provender. "One o' Nathanael 
Hawthorne's here, waitin' for a new owner. Can't suffer that
author no road. He's a (adj.) fool; too slow to catch grubs."

"Haven't got a book to my name, Dixon. Flying as light
as possible this trip. But, talking of scholarship, you were a
trifle too good for Fritz this afternoon."

"Simple," replied the bullock driver, modestly. "Habit <pb n="37"/>
I got into. But it's curious how these edicated words gits
such a (adv.) fine holt o' the proper meanin'. 'Classical
quotation is the Masonic grip of cultivated minds,' as ole
Doctor Ben Jonson used to say. I don't deny I put 'em
down for (adj.) gibberage till I got a sort o' insight. (Adv.)
useful, anyhow. When you git into an argument with a
feller, you can jist watch yer (adj.) slant an' lay the
opponent over with a sort o' bull's-eye phrase, an' he ain't
got a word to say. What the (sheol) *can* he say?"

"Yes, it gives you an unmerciful purchase," I conceded.
"But a man should spread his studies a bit. What are you
reading now?"

"Bible," replied Dixon, with a touch of 
self-righteousness, whilst indicating with a sideward glance the noblest
and least-understood compilation on earth, where it lay
in a kerosene-box, together with a supply of tobacco and
matches, a large dictionary, a well-worn pack of cards,
and the insufferable Hawthorne. "Got her in a swap for
one o' Ouidar's," he continued. "Ignorant galoots they'll
tell you she's a passel o' nonsense, but strikes me very
forcible the bloke that wrote the Bible he had forgot more'n
them other (sceptics) ever learned. An' as for it bein' true
 -- why, Jerusalem's to the good *now*, large as life, for 
 anybody to see. 'Spect you're a bit o' a ringer on Scripture?"

"I only wish I was. Certainly, I had to read a good deal
of it when I was too young to understand."

"That's on'y yer misforcune," replied Dixon gravely;
"it ain't yer fault. That's where my main (adj.) holt is -- 
graspin' what I read. Never knowed no more about the
Bible three monce ago nor I knowed about my 
gran'mother. Matter o' course, I thought hell was on'y a man's
own conscience; thought the divil was only a sort o'
byword; thought God was nature; an' so on. But I foun'
things a (adj.) sight different. No (adj.) shinannigan about
the Bible. It ain't frightened about offendin' people; an' it
don't give one stick o' tobacker difference between
Abraham on his throne an' the (derelict) at his gate, loafin'
for the manavelins off of his table. That's what I like her <pb n="38"/>
for. Straightest book ever wrote. But she gev me a (adj.)
fright," he continued, in an altered tone. "A (sheol) of a
(adj.) fright," he repeated thoughtfully.

"But surely you didn't find it *all* discouraging?" I
argued, contemplating with a listless interest the fine 
forehead and engaging face of the bullock driver.

"Dunno," replied Dixon dubiously. "Most of it's (adj.)
frightensome. But mebbe things'll work roun' all right by
the time a feller dies. Sneak in some (adj.) road. Anyhow,
I'm glad I ain't a Scribe, nor yet a Pharisee, nor yet a
hypocrite."

A minute of sombre silence, for our parallel forecasts
had reached the confines of that void whereinto no ray of
science may penetrate, to dissolve the hundred shapeless,
flickering wisps of Dogma.

But the fascination of a new book was on the receptive
mind of my companion; so, judiciously waiving the 
unpleasanter features of the work, he gave his harmless
pedantry its fling.

"Samson, he was the strongest (individual) ever lived,"
he remarked, in a careless tone; "an' Solomon he was the
wisest -- an' who do you think was the foolishest?"

"The man who built his house on the sand," I suggested.

"Ain't come to that bloke yet," replied Dixon, "but I'm
thinkin' Moses could give him about half-ways an' lick
him (adv.) bad. Yes, Moses was the foolishest (person)
ever lived. Bible cracks him up, mind you, because he was
a decent feller in his own sort o' soft-headed way. But he
didn't know his road roun'. Cripes, if I got slants like him
I'd shift things a bit! *My* (adj.) oath!" 

"Israelite, wasn't he?" I hazarded. "Perhaps I've been
mixing him up with somebody else."

"Ought to guard agen that," replied Dixon kindly. "No,
he was a Hebrew. Properly speaking, Israelites is Jews. But
Moses cottoned to the Israelites. That was his fust bit o'
(adj.) foolishness after he got on his own hook. When he
was quite a young feller his brothers sold him for thirty
bob to some Ishmaelites merchantmen on account of him
always dreamin' he was goin' to be cock-o'-the-walk an'
not bein' able to keep his (adj.) dreams to his self. Anyhow
he foun' his road into Egypt, an' there he dropt across the
Jews. Seems, so fur as I can make out, a feller name o' <pb n="40"/>
Parryo was bossin' the whole show in Egypt; an' he had
some sort o' (adj.) purchase on the Jews; an' he kep' them
makin' bricks and druv them most unmerciful; an' they
didn't know what the (adj. sheol) to do about it; so,
natural enough, they cried unto the Lord.

"Well, them ole times, the Lord used to mix Hisself up
a lot with people an' take no end o' trouble tryin' to keep
things a bit straight, an' He looked roun' for the 
foolishest bloke he could find to take on sich a (adv.) dead-horse
racket as gettin' the Jews out o' this perdicament, an' the
(person) He picked out was Moses -- a feller that might 'a
bin a swell among the Egyptians if he'd knowed when he
was well off."

(If the student of this simple memoir should 
thoughtlessly impute anything like irreverence to Dixon, I hereby
warn her that she does so at her own risk -- at the gravest
of all risks, namely, the risk of doing injustice. The 
comrade of nature, unconsciously profane, is rarely irreverent,
never flippant. For instance, though Dixon habitually
uttered the name "God" without the slightest mitigation
or remorse of voice, his pronunciation of "the Lord" was
unaffectedly grave and devout. Briefly, the worst you can
say of this wild-flower of the plains is that his Jahvistic
ideal was anthropomorphically on a level with that of the
writers of the Pentateuch and that his phraseology was
governed by his vocabulary. So, innocently paraphrasing
the sacred narrative, he continued),

"Accordin'ly, Moses went an' barracked with this
Parryo to let the children go. (They're always alluded to
by the name o' 'children' on account o' their (adj.) 
uselessness, an' pig-headedness, an' frightenedness.) Fust go
off, Moses on'y ast, quite simple like, for all hands to get a
couple or three days' spell, an' fetch their live stock, an'
flittin', an' tucker, an' every (adj.) thing they could rake
up to sacrifice to the Lord in the wilderness.

"'Rats!' says Parryo. 'Gor struth!' says he, 'did you
think you'd come Paddy over *me* Won't wash no (adj.)
road. Jist you (adv.) well scoot back,' says he to Moses,<pb n="41"/>
'an' tell the children to buck into their work a bit livelier,
or, take my (adj.) word for it,' says he, 'I'll straighten the
(malingerers) up!'

"But the Lord He backed up Moses, and sent locusts, an'
pleuro, an' Scotch greys, an' all manner o' curses on the
country. Some sort o' oversight, seemin'ly, for it was the
people that fell in, an' Parryo never turned a (adj.) hair.
Anyhow, after no end o' disturbance, the Jews got clear;
an' Parryo he rallied up the Egyptians an' sooled 'em on to
foller. Then a thing took place that no livin' man would
believe, without he seen it for his own self, or read it in
the Bible. Seems when the children come to the Red Sea
the water formed up into a (adv.) great bank on both
sides, an' they walked across, quite unconcerned. Then
when the Egyptians follered, the water walloped together,
an' the Egyptians was (adv.) well had. Course, it ain't our
place to say the wrong people was wiped out by mistake.
I s'pose it was to be.

"Well, Moses he knowed the track to the Land o' Canaan,
an' he went with the children to show them the road. This
was a land flowin' with milk an' honey, but there was some
middling rough stages across a bit o' country called the
Wilderness o' Sin. Anyone would think they'd put up with
a trifle o' hardship, considerin' what was behind them
an' what was in front, but they begun to growl at Moses
for fetchin' them into the wilderness to die. That was
always their (adj.) chorus -- 'fetchin' us into the wilderness
to die.'

"Then when the Lord foun' this was the sample o'
thanks He was gittin' for all the trouble He'd took, He
said He'd let them die and be d--d to them on'y for a
promise He'd made to Aminadab years and years before.
So he sent quails an' mannar, as much as they could
(adv.) well tuck into them. No go. They was like some
new chums that's bin half-starved at home, an' jammed
together like fleeces in a bale; an' these is the very blokes
that can't find a good word to say about a country where
they got any gosquanty o' room to look roun' an' a slant <pb n="42"/>
to be their own boss if they (adv.) well like. So, accordin'
to accounts, they murmured agen Moses, sayin':

"'What the (adj. sheol) did you want fetchin' us out
of Egypt, where we had as much meat and vegetables as
you could shake a stick at?' says they. 'You (adj.) rotten
(charlatan),' says they, 'seems like's if you was workin'
some little point fetchin' us into the wilderness to (adv.)
well die.'

"Then the Lord -- He was fearful hot-tempered them ole
times -- He says 'Stan' clear, Moses.' Says He, 'I'll destroy
these (adj.) varmin, promise or no promise; an' you can
make a fresh start with yer own kids.'

"Slant for Moses. Fact, you couldn't propose anythin'
softer -- but what d'you think the (adj.) fool done?"

"Snapped at it?" I suggested.

"Prayed for the (adj.) weeds," responded Dixon 
emphatically. "*Prayed* for 'em. Well, I be --" he paused to select
some adequate self-imprecation, culled a suitable one, and
delivered it with a vigorous rattle of consonants.

" Well, I'll only jist thin 'em out a bit this time,' says
the Lord. 'Must stop their (adj.) jaw some road.' So he
sent swarms o' snakes into the camp; but whether the
snakes picked out the individuals that growled, or whether
they bit anybody they could ketch, the Bible don't say.
Anyhow, Moses rigged up a brass snake on a pole, an'
stopped the poison actin'. It ain't as clear as it might be,
but things was different in the old times.

"Well, these Jews they sort of (verbed) along through
the Wilderness of Sin, till they come to the Land o' Canaan;
an' Moses he sent twelve spies on ahead to spy out the
nakedness o' the land, an' these emissaries fetched back a
sample bunch o' grapes, as much as two o' them could
stagger under. The account they give o' the country was
that a land flowin' with milk an' honey was no name for
it; but the Canaanites, an' the Rechabites, and the 
Mammonites, an' all the other (adj.) ites looked like as if they
was able to take their own (adj.) part agen anybody that
come foolin' roun' with the idea of shiftin' 'em.
<pb n="43"/>

"'We'll (adv.) soon see about that,' says Moses, 'We're
on for possessin' that land, no matter if we got to take a
couple or three (adv.) good lickin's at the start. *Audaces
fortuna* (adj.) *juvat*,' says he. 'All in favor o' this dart will
please signify the same in the usual manner,' says he. An'
what d'you think the Jews done?"

"Gave three cheers?" I suggested.

"Yes. Vill you buy a vatch? They lifted up their voice
an' wept. Lifted up their voice an' (adv.) well *wept*.

"'To (sheol) with you an' yer (adj.) Land o' Canaan,
you blatherin' morepoke,' says they to Moses. 'This comes
o' you fetchin' us out o' Egypt, where our hides was
whole, no matter if we *was* welted up to our work now
an' agen. We gone quite fur enough,' says they, 'so we'll
stone you to death for makin' a (adj.) fool of us, an' off
back to Egypt before we die o' fright.'

"'Stan' o' one side, Moses,' says the Lord. 'I ain't goin'
to put up with this sort of (adj.) nonsense one minit
longer. No use argying with a certain class o' people. I'll
jist wipe out these (adj.) soojee (cravens), an' make a
great nation out o' you an' yer own piccaninnies.'

"Slant number fifty, or so, for Moses; an' what does the
(adj.) fool do but he prays for the apostates again. *Prays*
for 'em.

"'Have it so, then,' says the Lord, 'but they got to go
back into the Wilderness of Sin an' do another perisher.
Sin by name and sin by nature.'

"'Hold on,' says the Jews. We're on the (adj.) job.
We'll go an' possess the land.'

"'Not if I know it,' says the Lord. 'You should have
thought about that before. Too late now. You're like the
Portigee divil -- when you're good, you're too good. Back
you go into the Wilderness an' think the (adj.) thing over
for a matter o' forty years. We'll have another confab
about it when you got some o' the stiffenin' took out o'
your (adj.) necks.'

"Course, this druv the Jews to desperation, an' they
roused up all hands an' went to hunt the old inhabitants <pb n="44"/>
out o' the land. Moses, he argied with 'em an' told 'em the
Lord was departed from them, but they only ordered
him off. Six rails an' a cap wouldn't hold 'em. Fair bustin'
with false pluck an' bluff an' blatherskite.

"But the Canaanites, an' the Rechabites, an' the whole
(adj.) fraternity of ites -- Hittites was the name they got
after, on account o' what took place -- they rolled into
the Jews an' knocked (adj. sheol) out o' them, an' the
remains o' the (poltroons) bolted back to their own camp
with their tails properly down, an' lifted up their voice an'
wept to some purpose. They was out of it.

"So Moses, the (adj.) fool, he cheered 'em up and fetched
'em back the road they come, an' travelled 'em back an'
forrid in the Wilderness of Sin for forty years. Every now
an' agen they used to round on Moses, an' be on the point
o' stonin' him to death, an' the Lord would lose His temper
agen, and it'd take Moses all his time to steady Him.
Otherways, Moses jist took things as they come, an' kep'
reasonin' with the malcontents, an' gittin' up feasts of
tabernacles, an' feasts of unleavened bread, an' feasts of
this, that, an' the other (adj.) thing. 'Tabernacles' is Latin
for mia-mias, and 'unleavened bread' is damper.

"Last instance of Moses' foolishness. One time he was
away on some business with the Lord, an' the Jews they
scraped up all their jewellery, an' melted it, an' made a
golden calf, and was holdin' a corroboree over it an' goin'
on with their (adj.) childishness, as usual, an' up comes
Moses, ropeable -- and what d'you think he done?"

"Confiscated the calf?" I suggested.

"Not his (adj.) height. He seized it, like a case o'
tobacker at the Customs, an' groun' it into powder, an'
mixed it with water, an' made the delinquents drink the
water -- an' so good-bye to as much as would have kep' him
independent for life. Fair chased with every (adj.) 
description o' slants, an' never froze on to one o' them. Got worse
as he got older an' died at last on top of a mountain, like
some pore swaggie -- a man that might have bin at the very
top o' the tree if he'd collared half the slants that come his<pb n="45"/>
road. I got no pity for a feller like that. Fact, I got no pity
for anybody that crawls after Jews. Bad eggs, the Jews.
When them temporisers was commanded to do anythin'
good they used to forgit, or buck, or dodge out of it some
(adj.) road; but when they was commanded to stone 
anybody -- whoop! they was there quick an' lively. My (adj.)
oath."

"Much the same with ourselves at the present day,
Dixon," I remarked, with the magnanimity of one who has
dined well. "Think over it every time you hear of 
somebody getting hanged."

"Moke of a different (adj.) color," replied the bullock
driver gravely, as he began to pack away his primitive
table-service. "The world's a (sheol) of a sight better
now nor it was in them ole times, an' the main reason is
because there's a fair mixter of other people stead of Jews,
Jews, Jews runnin' the whole (adj.) contract. Another
thing's got a lot to do with it" -- he paused, then continued
with marked reverence -- "there's a (adv.) great 
improvement in the Lord's way o' workin'. Eased off a lot -- ain't
He?" Another pause, then in a wistful tone, whilst 
suspending his domestic labor, "Now, onna bright, Collins,
do you think the fear of the Lord will save a person?"

"We're led to believe so."

"But is that what you was taught, or is it only yer own
(adj.) idear?"

"It's what I was taught, and taught by professing
Christians!"

"My strong point," responded Dixon, with ill-concealed
relief. "Grand (adj.) holt -- ain't she? *Spes tutissima* (adj.)
*coelis*." He lit his pipe on the strength of her. "Hullo,
here's Rigby. More the merrier. Plenty a tea in the billy,
anyhow." And he proceeded to relay the spread corn sack
with his frugal store.

Rigby met my glance of surprise with a far-away, dreamy
look; then, with the same preoccupied air, he walked
across to his wagonette, and drew his tucker-box from 
beneath the seat. Whereupon Dixon became so frankly 
offensive that Rigby put the box back, and took his place at
the bullock driver's ocean-bounded table.

"I didn't expect you so soon, Colonel," he remarked.
"I can't stay long," he replied. "Nice evening." The
last observation was addressed to a flash-looking young
man, who came up with a rod and line in his hand.

"I've seen worse, an', at the same time, I've seen better,"
replied the young fellow. "Whereabouts was it that your
mate caught that thirty-pounder?" he continued, turning
to Dixon.

"Sit down and have a drink o' tea," replied the bullock
driver. "Who was tellin' you about the (adj.) fish?"

"What's that got to do with you? I want to know where
he caught it?"

"Well, you kin jist (adv.) well fine out," replied Dixon,
with dignity. "Polite sort o' (person) *you* are," he 
continued as the other strode away. "Bin dragged up anyhow,
seemin'ly."

"Who is he?" I asked.

"Kangaroo hunter, supposed to be. One (adj.) horse an'
no dogs. Nothin' but a rifle. Camped over there, aside the
big log. Look out for yer dog tonight, Collins."<pb n="47"/>

"More sacks to the mill," I remarked, as another man
approached us with a fishing-rod in his hand. A little, puny,
mild-looking man this time.

"Good evening, gentlemen. I believe Thompson hooked
a fine fish this morning somewhere here?"

"Who was tellin' you?" asked Dixon.

"That foreigner up at the pub."

"Well, yes; he got a thirty-pounder this mornin'," replied
Dixon, suavely. "Landed her after a (sheol) of a (adj.)
struggle, but when he thought she was safe, away she goes
slitherin' down the bank an' into the (adj.) river agen.
Have a drink o' tea. There's a (adj.) pannikin."

"I've just had supper, thank you."

"What're you baitin' with?"

"Bit of roasted possum -- can't beat it," replied the visitor,
as he retired towards the river bank.

"Decent little (fellow)," commented Dixon, without
waiting till the other had got out of hearing. "Londoner,
by perfession Cockney, with no inside. Name o' Furlong.
Scrats out a (adv.) good livin', possumin' in the winter,
when the skins is good. That's his (adj.) spring cart over
there. He on'y come this forenoon; an' now he's got dozens
o' sheepskins in the lagoons, fishin' for leeches. Gits the
raw pelts cheap at the Wash and sen's the (adj.) leeches to
Melb'n wholesale. Great little (fellow.) Stuff any (adj.)
thing, from a emu to a tomtit. Best (adj.) bee-hunter in
these parts, too. Got a eye like a (adj.) hawk. Got a 
bee-tree this afternoon, that I'd bin walkin' past a dozen times,
an' he collars that (adv.) great treacle can an' fills her full
o' honey for me, an' no compliment."

Whilst imparting these biographical notes, Dixon had
taken from an adjacent hollow stump an old billy half-full
of live mussels, in water; now he laid three of these in
front of the fire and replaced the billy.

"Allowed to be the best (adj.) possumer on the track,"
he resumed; "an' he tells me he wasn't worth a (courtesan's)
curse at the trade he was brought up to."

"A familiar experience, Dixon," remarked Rigby, <pb n="48"/>
partially rousing himself from his reverie. "*Non omnia possumus
omnes* -- which may be freely translated, 'We can't all of us
be possumers.'"

"Hum," replied Dixon, warily. "Anyhow, me an' him
got acquainted campin' together on the Island two year
ago. That (man)'s got a blessin' on him, jist the same's
Thompson's got his (adj.) curse. Spends mostly all his
spare time readin' the Bible and prayin'. Puts the (adj.)
stuns on me how some chaps kin be so good. Roughest 
contract ever anybody took on is to do everything to the
glory of God, but that (fellow) manages it. Can't you eat
no more, Rigby? Well, I'll pack up the (adj.) 
jewel'ry-box, an' we'll go an' have a shake for this 
thirty-(adj.)-pounder."

Meanwhile, I had rigged up my fishing-tackle. Rigby,
having finished his meal, glanced at his watch, hesitated a
moment, then walked to his wagonette, and returned with
a jointed fishing-rod. Dixon's tackle was already prepared.
Each of us took one of the gaping mussels and baited his
hook with the naked mollusc, now shrunken and 
toughened by the slight roasting which had opened the shell.

"My intentions ran on another kind of fishing," 
remarked Rigby to me, as we made our way down the
bank. "However, I may combine the two forms for a
very short time, since the circumstances are so 
contributory as almost to amount to compulsion."

He was right. Better conditions could not have been
supplied to order. Three large red gums stood on the edge
of the river ten or twelve yards apart, and their roots,
washed clean by the stream, afforded seats and foothold
anywhere on the steep slope; while before us the 
faintly-swirling water seemed full of promise. The kangaroo
hunter and Furlong were already seated, watching their
floats. The fascination of the thirty-pounder was over us
all.

It was a beautiful evening -- dead calm, with just that
flavor of sultriness which, at a later hour, matures into
temperature so perfect that the most accomplished tippler<pb n="49"/>
wouldn't know whether he wanted his refreshment iced or
mulled. Any person whose smelling apparatus was not
debauched by smoking would have found the air fragrant
with scent of pennyroyal and rich with aroma exhaled from
countless tons of eucalyptus leaves. Best of all, no 
annoying hum of mosquitoes marred a concert of evening sounds,
made up by the homely clatter of myriad frogs and the
tangled melody of a dozen bells, copious in range of tone
and timbre. And from time to time, like a drunken 
Welshman talking in his sleep, came the guttural discourse of a
possum, or perhaps the mumble of a bear; while at shorter
intervals some solitary mopoke solemnly announced 
himself by name, eliciting occasional response from two or
three far-away friends, who seemed to call themselves
"pope-pope" -- certain sound-waves of the note being 
exhausted in transit. Three hilarious kookaburras, sitting
side by side on a dead branch close by, did their best to
liven things up before retiring for the night; while now
and then some dejected curlew yelled his probably 
imaginary woes on the sympathetic air; and away, in different
directions, the monotonous and foolish barking of several
dogs might lead the thrifty soul to meditate on the 
unpreventable leakage of Energy in this world of ours.

Behind where we sat, a sheep-proof fence, running down
from the pub, terminated in one of the three big trees I
have mentioned. The east side of this fence was a grazing
paddock, consisting of frontage land, purchased or stolen
by a squatter in the good old times, and now rented by a
local boss-cockie. The pub was part of the same property;
all belonging to some indefinite person in Melbourne.

Just behind us, a section of charred ruins, overgrown with
nettles and variegated thistles, showed where the old 
out-station had stood in the corner of the land. The place was
known as Cameron's Paddock, from the name of the second
last, and longest-bleeding, tenant.

The west side of the fence was river frontage, the 
redgum flats coming southward to the road, while the river
itself swept away miles to the north, and again approached<pb n="50"/>
the road about two miles westward, thus forming a fine
bend, mostly inaccessible to loafing sheep, by reason of
billabongs, lagoons, and swamps, and therefore much
valued by such bullock drivers as knew its geography and
could avail themselves of its resources.

Here I may remark that, as a rule, the 
trans-Murrumbidgee bullock driver, like the emu, is more inclined to
follow water conservation northward through the 
back-blocks than to drift down into the distracting civilisation
of the Murray. But Thompson, Dixon and a few others,
being Victorians, and familar with many desirable spots
along the Border River, sometimes condescended -- 
*condescended*, I say -- to put in a month or two on their native
territory when the grasshoppers began to starve on the
plains through which the Lachlan ought to have run.
Victorian trips were too degradingly short, and Victorian
wheat too abominably heavy handling for these aristocrats;
but, as Falstaff says, young men must live and seasons are
not unknown when -- to use a composite metaphor for
which Thompson is responsible -- the rat who refuses to
leave the sinking ship will be reduced to live on the boiled
tongues of his own dead bullocks. Thompson had been
that rat.

Whilst we were selecting comfortable seats, and 
throwing our lines into the river, the rhythmic pattering of a
cantering horse came faintly on the air, followed by the
jangle of a bell at the wagons on the bank above us, and
the shrill neigh of a liberated animal, starting in search of
his mates. Then Rigby, mentally shaking himself up, turned
toward me and murmured confidentially:

"By the way I was just going to ask you --"

"That you, Thompson?" shouted Dixon.

"No," replied Thompson, appearing on the bank.

"How are you, Rigby? I'm glad to see you. All hands 
fishing? Any luck?"

"Stacks of it, so fur," replied Dixon, "only it ain't the
proper specie. Layin' wait for that (adj.) thirty-pounder
you lost here. Ole Parley-voo told us about her."<pb n="51"/>

"Ah, I remember I mentioned it to him this morning.
And there's five of you on the contract, like the five foolish
girls in the Bible. However, I'll keep you company, if 
anyone can shout me a bait."

"Plenty mussels in the ole billy in the holler stump aside
the (adj.) fire," replied Dixon. "Don't roast none but the
one you want. Keep the molluscs fresh. Letter for you in
the pocket o' yer (adj.) wagon -- forrided from Hay."

"Only somebody sticking me up for damages, or 
claiming one of my bullocks, or threatening me with seven years
for passing a bad cheque, or perhaps some new style of
misfortune," replied Thompson wearily, as he turned back
to prepare his fishing-tackle.

"Swore off o' smokin' a fortnit ago, an' he naterally gits
as miserable as a bandicoot when night comes on," observed
Dixon. "Reckons to git his (adj.) curse shifted through
knockin' off his bad habits little by little. Hard to say.
Worth tryin', anyhow."

While we mused over this suggestion -- each in his own
way, Thompson joined us, threw his line into the river,
seated himself on a root, and sighed deeply.

"I get melancholy every time I see this camp," he
remarked. "I knew the people that lived here, where the
house is burned down. Old associations of ten years ago.
Now everything's changed, and changed for the worse.
The people are gone -- gave up the place three or four years
back, and selected away towards the Coolaman. The
wagon I had then is at the bottom of the Murrumbidgee,
the bullocks are gone, every scrap of tackle is gone, the
horse is gone, even the dog is gone; my youth is gone, my
hopes are gone; and I'm neither use nor ornament in the
world. It would take a smarter man than myself to tell
what I'm living for."

"*Sic transit gloria* (adj.) *mundi*" observed Dixon, as if
to himself.

"What was her name?" asked Rigby.

"Agnes," replied Thompson sadly. "Their house stood
on the bank behind us here, where you see the thistles<pb n="52"/>
growing now. Her father was a hard, strict, religious
Scotchman, with fierce eyebrows. His name was Cameron 
-- Lyon Cameron."

"I come across a sheep-drover name o' 'Swearing
Cameron' three seasons ago," remarked Dixon, 
thoughtfully. "Might be some relation. These things often runs in
the blood."

"I'll tell you the whole story," pursued Thompson, "and
you'll see what it is for a man to live in the position that
I'm in. His whole life is just composed of retreats from
Moscow, one after another. Sometimes it seems to slacken
off a bit, and you think the infernal thing has sort of 
exhausted itself, but it's only gathering strength for a fresh
spring; and before you know what you're about, it's on
you again. I'm not a superstitious man myself, but I can't
help noticing that ever since I cheated that dead man,
Providence seems to go clean out of its way to have a
clip at me. Now, this instance of Agnes Cameron is a
proof of what I say."

During this confession the little trapper, leaving the
butt of his rod jammed among the roots, had picked his
way along the water-scarped bank to the speaker's side.
"I beg your pardon," said he, in a low, eager, voice,
"were you camped about two miles from Mathoura, four
years ago -- four years on the third of March last?"

Thompson pondered. "I don't remember -- Oh, *yes*, that's
all right."

"I was sure I knew your voice," replied Furlong. "I
just camped here today." A pause. Then the two shook
hands, and the trapper returned to his line.

"Yes, boys," continued Thompson, sadly. "She was the
only girl I ever was properly in love with, and one Sunday
I took her out in a canoe --"

"This won't do, Steve," I interrupted, with some severity.
"You must tell us how you met her first, and what induced
you to fall in love with her; also what sort of a canoe it was,
and who you stole it from -- and, in fact, all the details."

"I can tell you exactly what induced me to fall in love
with her, Tom. It was yourself that did it -- indirectly, of
course. I'll tell you how. It was in January '73, that I
camped in this bend for the first time, to have a few
months' spell before the next wool. Now, you remember
that I met you at Deniliquin in the spring of '72, and we
spent a Sunday together at my camp on the common? Do
you remember telling me then that there were ten 
masterpieces of poetry that nobody on earth, except yourself, had
ever read clean through, or ever would? I took a list of
them at the time, if you remember, but, in any case, I'm
not likely to forget the names. Let's see -- *Paradise Lost* and
*Regained*, counting the two as one; Goethe's *Faust*, 
especially the second part; Dante's *Divine Comedy*, Spenser's
*Faerie Queene*; Thomson's *Seasons*; Young's *Night
Thoughts*; Cowper's *Task*; Tennyson's *In Memoriam*;
Edwin Arnold's *Light of Asia*; and, lastly, any poem of
Walt Whitman's.<pb n="54"/>

"Well, being young and flash at the time, I began to
think how I would shine if I had those books at my finger
ends, and you know the sort of lunacy that comes over a
man when he fancies himself good enough to go through
with a thing that everybody has shied clear of. I seemed to
look forward into the future and overhear people saying:
'See that cove! -- that's the man I was telling you about -- 
that's Thompson -- best-educated fellow on the track.' And
this ambition got possession of me till at last I wrote to
Cole for the prices of the best rough-and-ready editions
delivered at the Melbourne Railway Station. The end of
the matter was, that the parcel was waiting for me at
Echuca when I crossed the river on my way to this bend
to spell for the next wool. Of course, the ten books included
a lot of reading that wasn't properly in the contract, but I
wanted to be on the safe side, and I was game for anything
in the way of reading.

"I camped on a little sand-hill, half-a-mile across there.
I had nothing to interfere with my reading except to boil
the billy about once a day and make a damper about once
a week; and between my natural laziness and the strain on
my mind, I got too feeble to do even that much properly.
But I stuck to my studies, though I'm a slow reader at the
best of times. When I got so disgusted with one book that
I couldn't face another line, I used to take a spell and
then tackle some other book, and so on -- always marking
the place where I knocked off, and never slumming a
word."

"But we want your love-story, Steve," interposed the
Major.

"This is my love-story, and I'm telling it according to
Tom's specifications. Better decide whether I'm to study
your taste or his. Or, if you like, I'll drop it altogether."

"*Ne Jupiter qaidem* (adj.) *omnibus*" observed Dixon,
sententiously.

"Are *you* to the fore?" growled Thompson. "You ought
to be yarded, without water or tucker, till you learn to
speak English again."<pb n="55"/>

"Didn't mean no (adj.) offence," replied Dixon, 
scoring heavily with the ostentatious mildness of his tone. "I
on'y shoved in a word, as a *amicus* (adj.) *curiae*, in a 
manner o' speakin'."

"We all apologise; myself foremost," said Rigby. "Go
on with your story in your own way."

"Very well," replied Thompson. "After I had been
camped about a month I went across one day to inquire
about a roan steer that had taken up with my bullocks, and
there I saw Agnes for the first time. She was a fine lump of a
girl, no doubt; but my mind was so disordered and 
stupefied by the class of books I had been reading that she
seemed like a bird of paradise, and she'll have that 
appearance to me as long as I've got a head on my body." He
paused, and sighed deeply.

"Well, I bought this roan steer off Cameron, and that
started a sort of acquaintance. Agnes was just twenty, and
she had two brothers of sixteen or seventeen. Mrs Cameron
was a nice, fat, easy-going sort of woman, frightened to
death of Cameron. Everybody was frightened of that man,
and no one worse than myself. Most God-fearing man I
ever knew. But the boys were great disciples of mine. Many
an evening the three of us have sat fishing here, where we
are now. And many a Sunday morning I've dressed myself
as like a Presbyterian elder as I could come it and sneaked
across here, to fawn like a dog on Cameron, and go 
mooning about the place like a harmless lunatic. By-and-by I
got a letter from my sister that fairly knocked me. Cameron
happened to be a townie of my father's next neighbor
(that was old McFarlane, Tom), and it seems he had
written to this cove for particulars about me. Not much to
build upon, of course, but I fancied that Cameron 
afterwards talked to me in a tone that I could imagine him
using to the son of a respectable man, and I caught at the
hope as the drowning man catches at --"

"Not at a straw, if you please, Steve," interposed Rigby.
"Well -- at an anvil. However, time passed till I began to
think about starting for Hay. Mind you, I was in a curious <pb n="56"/>
position. Agnes and I understood each other, of course, and
we felt that nothing short of death would shift either of us,
but then again we seemed to have very little say in the
matter. We were both in such bodily fear of her dad that
we were sort of paralysed. It's all very well for you to say
that you'd have done this, or that, or the other thing.
You'd play (sheol). So would I. But if you were withered
up with the course of study that I had gone through, and
had old Cameron to deal with, you'd do just as I did. You
see, I didn't know what value he put on me, -- in fact, I
didn't know what value I put on myself. Sometimes I
seemed a fine, promising young chap; and other times I
seemed about on a level with a Chinaman. It was those
infernal books that did it. I think Mrs Cameron stood to
me. At all events, one day Cameron made me tell all my
affairs, and then brought in Agnes' name, and finally told
me that if I could give a good account of myself in 
another year he would allow me to write to her. But I must
turn over a new leaf in the matter of thrift. Of course, I
promised anything and everything, and began to feel like
a respectable, right-thinking citizen, never considering the
thing that was on me.

"This happened on a Saturday morning. Cameron had a
habit of finding some work of necessity for Sundays to
keep the family out of mischief. He was starting away
down the country that afternoon with the two boys to
meet some store cattle, not expecting to be back for four
or five days, and as I was to start for Hay on the Monday
morning we weren't likely to meet again for six months.
In the meantime, I was to write to him, but not to Agnes.
You'll understand that I had been loafing in the bend for
four or five months, and by this time it was well on in the
winter.

"Now, you'll see what comes of doing things on 
Sunday that ought to be done the night before. On Sunday
morning I went to the smiddy that used to be a mile up
the road here to get some keys I had ordered, and I was
coming back along the frontage with the keys in my hand,<pb n="57"/>
and when I struck the river about half-a-mile above here,
the first thing that caught my eye was a canoe, with a
couple of oars in it, sailing along on its own account. She
was a heavy wooden concern about four feet wide and
twenty feet long -- just a hollow tree, with the right bend
dressed into shape, two or three boards nailed across for
seats, and a couple of irons like spurs stuck one in each side
for you to work the oars in.

"She was travelling within a few yards of this bank, so
I peeled off and slipped in and snaked her ashore with a
bit of clothes-line that was hanging to one end. I tied her
up while I went back after my duds. Then I got on board,
and came rowing down here, like Trickett himself, and
stuck her snout among the roots, just above where Rigby's
sitting at the present moment. Of course, the river was
twelve or fifteen feet higher than it is now.

"After dinner, nothing would do me but to take Agnes
out for a pleasure trip in the canoe. She was on, but her
mother was dubious. However, I argued so hard, and lied
so fluently about my skill in handling boats that Mrs
Cameron gave in at last, and off we went. It wasn't the first
time I had been in a boat, but it was the first time I ever
had an oar in my hand, and the new-chum flashness was
strong on me. This was about two in the afternoon, and
we were to be back in a couple of hours. Of course, I knew
Cameron wouldn't allow any such Godless recreation if he
was at home, but I quieted my conscience with the
thought that what the eye never sees, the heart never
grieves for."

Thompson paused, sighed heavily, and mechanically felt
for his pipe. Then, even in the gloaming, I marked his form
assume a resolute, almost arrogant, bearing. The haughty
consciousness of self-subdual was more grateful, after all,
than even a soul-satisfying smoke; it threw boldness on his
forehead, gave firmness to his breath, and he looked like
some grim warrior new risen up from death.

Thompson resumed. "I just let the boat drift, dipping the
oars in a light, off-hand way, to steady her along; and the
time passed as pleasantly as time can pass, and quicker than
it ever did before, or ever will again. Agnes was even
happier than I was, for the whole transaction just came up
to her poor little idea of devilment. As it happened, the sun
wasn't shining that afternoon, and my watch had gone
cronk some weeks before; so I could only guess at the
time. But we wanted to be on the safe side, so presently we
agreed that it was time to be getting back. Just then we
saw a boy putting a night line in the river, and I says to
him:

" 'I say, sonny,' says I, 'how far back is it to Mr
Cameron's?'

" 'Well,' says he, 'I dunno how fur it is by the road you
come, but you won't do bad if you pad it in five miles.
Ain't that Agnes Cameron you got with you?' says he.
'Wonder how they let her come out. I seen Cameron half
an hour ago.'

" 'No,' says I, 'you couldn't. He went away yesterday!'

" 'I know he did,' says the boy. 'I seen him and Billy and
Malky goin' away yesterday, and I seen him comin' back
today by his own self. Ought to be home about dark.'

"We were travelling so fast just then that the boy had<pb n="59"/>
to yell out his last remarks after us, and by this time we
swooped round a point, and lost sight of him. Of course,
Agnes began to cry, and, of course, I kissed her; and I
remember to the present day that the taste of the poor
girl's lips reminded me of dead leeches. But there was no
time to be lost, so I welted away with one oar for about
a quarter of an hour till I got the boat turned, and then
started to send her up against the stream. But she was over
a ton weight and she took such a terrific hold of the
current that I could hardly gain an inch while I was 
rowing my best; and, at every fourth lift or so, I used to miss
the water and turn a back summerset; and then, while I was
getting into position again, she would get the speed on her,
and by the time I had steadied her I was heels over tip
again. And all this time we were going round one bend
after another and evening was coming on full speed. Then
I could see that there was nothing for it but to get ashore
and walk home, and I told Agnes so. And to make matters
better, the poor girl had chilblains, and her Sunday boots
punished her so that she had taken them off soon after we
started, and now she was tugging and panting and half
swearing to get them on again, but all to no purpose, while
I was tumbling over the top of her, and nearly capsizing
the boat.

"However, I aimed for a good landing-place, and hit a
steep, greasy bank about fifty yards lower down, where
Agnes couldn't get out; and altogether by the time we got
landed, the night was fairly on us, and it was beginning to
rain. When we were landing, I held on to some roots and
kept the boat jammed against the bank while Agnes crept
out on her hands and knees. Then I let go and stepped
ashore. But clumsy as the boat was, it was lively enough to
swing out while I had one foot on the edge of it and the
other on the bank. Of course, I plopped into three or four
feet of water; and before I had cleared myself, the boat
was well out into the main current, and off full tilt for
Echuca, with Agnes' boots and shawl and umbrella on<pb n="60"/>
board. There was a curse on that boat." The narrator
paused in gloomy abstraction, then resumed.

"When we got up on the bank, things looked worse than
ever. No appearance of a light anywhere; not even the
bark of a dog to be heard; no sign of population; nothing
but a wretched red-gum flat, most likely miles across, and
cut up in all directions with creeks. However, the first
thing to be done was to get out to the main road, so I
cheered Agnes up, and gave her my coat and boots, and
we made a start together. Naturally, a couple of hundred
yards brought us block up against a billabong. We run it
along to the left for a quarter of a mile, and found it joined
on with the river. Then we turned back, and run it half a
mile to the right, and found it stuck on to the river there,
too. Of course, we were on an island, and by this time it
was pitch dark, and raining cats and dogs. Then I could
see that the infernal thing had roused itself, and was fairly
on the job. So I was thankful for the very small mercy of a
hollow tree, with just enough room in it for Agnes to pack
herself as scientifically as a chicken in a clocked egg.

"Next consideration was a fire, so I groped under logs
for dry leaves, till I got enough for a commencement. It
was a close shave for matches. I had just three left, but
they were dry, for the box was a waterproof one. My
fingers were numb with cold, so I managed to drop the
first match and lose it; but the next was a success. I got
the handful of leaves lit, but I had to supply the fire in its
infancy with wet stuff, and in spite of all I could do, it
dwindled and flickered and died out."

"I'd a give five bob to hear you dealin' with the (adj.)
subject," remarked Dixon, complacently.

"You'd have lost your money. I had another match left.
I spent a quarter of an hour groping out more dry leaves
and twigs. Then I got Agnes' handkerchief for kindling,
and made a final attempt. But the match turned out to
have no head. I didn't come out. I was past that. I was
crushed. It wasn't the hardship, for I've had worse nights,
and I expect to have worse still before I die, but it was the<pb n="61"/>
troubled mind along with it. And in cases of this kind a
girl is as foolish as a foal, so there was Agnes crying and
blowing her nose all the time, and wondering whatever she
would do; and there was me walking back and forward,
with my teeth going like a chaff-cutter, and the fine rain
for the farmer coming down wholesale where there was
no thanks for it. I wouldn't go through it again -- not for
Father Peter. The hardship was as bad as Dante's Inferno,
and the trouble was a lot worse than Milton's Hell."

"Hear, hear," said I, rattling my feet on a root. "Wasn't
it worth while to be led into all this unpleasantness by
those books, when they repaid you with the power of
illustrating it in such a scholarly way?"

"Case of *vigilate et* (adj.) *orate*, when a man's in such
a (sheol) of a (adj.) st-nk," interjected Dixon, with 
good-natured emulation, as the last syllable left my lips.

"Go ahead, pile it on!" retorted Thompson, maliciously.
"I don't know any surer way of falling in the fat -- and I
ought to be an authority."

"Let them fill up their measure of iniquity, Steve,"
remarked the Deacon. "Go on with your story."

"Well," resumed Thompson, "after, about three months
daylight came, and the rain cleared off. Agnes hadn't felt
the cold much, for she had a layer of fat all over her, and
her clothes were dry; so she had dropped asleep at the
drowsy time in the morning. As soon as it was light enough
to see, I had explored the billabong and found one place
where the current was middling strong. I tested this spot
from bank to bank to make sure of the bottom, and found
it only from three to four feet deep. So I got the loan of
my boots for the trip, and took Agnes on my shoulders
to keep her out of the water, and a good pole in both hands
to prop against the current; and I made the passage with
about two ounces of strength to spare, for she was eleven
stone, all out -- and I was anything but fresh.

"By this time the sun was out nice and warm, and the
rest of our journey was easy. We came straight in this
direction, thinking to get a shorter cut than the main<pb n="62"/>
road. Besides, we felt modest about showing off before the
public, for I was bare-footed and bare-headed and wet and
miserable-looking, and Agnes' face was dirty, and her hair
all wild, and her clothes torn, and she was lame with her
chilblains, and altogether she looked as if she had been on
a bad drunk; and the terror of old Cameron made us both
look as if we ought to be in jail, and knew it.

"When we had gone a little better than a mile, we saw
a farm house in front of us, and we knew where we were.
Agnes was acquainted with the people of the farm, so we
decided to give them a call. It was Quarterman's 
place -- two or three miles from here by the road. He's a pompous
individual in his own little way. He took on himself to
cross-examine me about our misfortune, and he ended by
writing a note to Cameron over it. But Mrs Quarterman
did all she could for us, and presently we started off home
in a spring cart, with a half-grown lump of a girl to
hammer the old moke along. Of course, this girl had to
carry the note for Cameron. But now that the adventure
was drawing to an end, I found a peace of mind that all
the old fogies on the river couldn't disturb. I was as happy
as Larry."

"I don't perceive much opening for self-felicitation yet,"
observed Rigby. "The figure of Cameron seems to loom
large in perspective."

"Now, I've told this yarn to three different women, and
they all saw the point at a glance," replied Thompson.
"But we're dense beggars, the cleverest of us. Anyway, if
the idea had struck me before, I would have been proof
against all the misery of the night. It just occurred to me
that this bit of a mishap would grow into a very good
scandal, and that nobody else would have Agnes at any
price. My old mistake, forgetting the thing that was on
me.

"However, after we got started, I whispered to Agnes,
so that Jim couldn't overhear (Jim was the girl's name),
'Agnes,' says I, 'it's a dead certainty that I won't be allowed
about your place for some time to come. Now listen and<pb n="63"/>
remember. In six or eight months, if I'm alive, I'll come
in the night and blaze that big red gum, with the lot of
mistletoes on it, just opposite your bedroom window. When
you see the fresh blaze, you'll know that I'll be waiting for
you that evening at sunset, in the whipstick scrub, at the
right-hand lower corner of your calf-paddock. I'll wait
there every night for a week.'

"I impressed this on her mind, and cheered her up, and
we jogged along to about half-way home, when up comes
Cameron behind us on horseback, as savage as a bull-ant.
He ordered me out of the spring cart, and I obeyed like
clockwork, after giving Jim a half-sovereign for herself.
Then, whilst the spring cart went on, Cameron stayed a
few minutes, and told me what he thought of me. I took
it like a poor man with a large family. I could afford to
take it in that way, for I seemed to have a grip that he
couldn't shake. When he had finished, I went down to my
wagon, and yoked up, and camped that night twelve mile
beyond Quarterman's, and in less than a fortnight I was at
Hay, still gloating over my mortgage on Agnes."

"And the books that I had recommended -- did you master
any of them?" I asked.

"No, Tom, I didn't. They mastered me. I gave them to
the Public Library at Hay. They reflected a glimpse of
credit on me in the end; but, as I told the secretary when
he was writing my name and title in the front of each, and
complimenting me on my choice of reading -- 'Stephen
Thompson, Esquire,' says I to him, 'has never been the
same man since he tackled them.' "

Again Thompson sighed hopelessly, shoved his hand
half way down his right-hand pocket, then slowly 
withdrew it, whilst his whole attitude and demeanor showed
that he was vividly realising how sublime a thing it is to
suffer and be strong.

"Did you keep your appointment with the girl?" asked the
Colonel, after a pause.

"Well, Providence took a hand in the arrangement, and
I'm not rebellious enough to complain," replied Thompson,
with the diseased humility of a self-pitying egotist. "I'll
finish the story. It was in June '73, that I left here, and I
came back in February, '74. I had made a splendid season
of it -- the best I had ever had. The squatters were coining
money, and there was no end of new country fresh stocked
with sheep in place of cattle; and the grass was good, and
I had one of the best teams that ever travelled Riverina.
We'll never see such times again. Before Christmas I had
cleared two hundred and ten notes, beyond all expenses,
and my team nothing the worse. Full loaded both ways
every trip, and me grabbing the monish till I could feel
my nose growing big and hooked and my eyes taking the
appearance of black beads. I was a man to be avoided.

"During the season I wrote two letters to Cameron,
apologising for the other affair, and reporting progress in
a modest, off-hand way, but he never answered. So, as I
was telling you, I got back in February. I camped about a
mile below here and that evening I swam the river with a
tomahawk in my teeth, and blazed that big tree -- there it
is, just opposite. Next evening I was at the corner of the<pb n="65"/>
calf-paddock, and who should come pushing through the
scrub but Cameron himself.

"'Now, let me hear what you have to say, Thompson,'
says he, in an awful voice. 'I'll represent my daughter this
evening, if you've no objection.'

"Nothing for it but to face him square, though, in a
manner of speaking Agnes seemed to have gone over to the
enemy, and I felt like a tree suddenly stripped of every
leaf in a hail-storm."

"A vicious combination of metaphor and simile, Steve,"
remarked the Senator, critically. "Also, the latter seems
somewhat exaggeratory. A man with a first-class carrying
plant and £210 might be regarded as relatively 
umbrageous."

"I agree with you there," replied Thompson, bitterly.
"However, I found myself able to speak to Cameron in a
manly way, and he took it in such good part that I began
to think he was making allowance for the purchase I had
on Agnes; but it was the old mistake of not allowing for
the thing that's on me. So there we stood, while I told him
the whole story of my wool season, and when I had done,
he canted his head to one side, and says he, 'Do you expect
a man of my experience to believe a yarn like *that*?'

"'Well,' says I, 'it does sound a bit hollow, but that's not
my fault; the story's true, post to finish.'

"'And it is a fact,' says he, 'that you've got no plant now
except nine skeletons and a wagon?'

"'Gospel truth,' says I. 'If you have any doubt about it,
you can come to my camp, and see for yourself.'

"'And how much cash have you to the good?' says he.

" I'll conceal nothing from you, Mr Cameron,' says I.
'I've just got three-and-fourpence in hand, and I'm about
twelve notes in debt; but, against this, I have thirty-six
notes coming from M'Culloch.'

"'Look here, Thompson,' says he, 'if ever I catch you
in sight of my place again, I'll put the dogs on you,' and
he wheels round and walks off."

"I don't blame him," observed the Major. "Can't you<pb n="66"/>
perceive that it requires a higher order of mind than yours
to make one substantial structure out of two thin ones,
without showing the joint? In fact, your composite style
of architecture, though it may make the Washington
laugh cannot but make the Munchausen grieve. Just stand
off and look at your two-story yarn. One moment you're
clothed in property and cash; the next moment you're
sitting at your own slip-panel, full of indigence."

"You've described my position to a nicety," replied
Thompson gloomily. "That was the year I fell into the
hands of Dick the Devil."

"I thought it was in '74 or '75 that Dick was made the
instrument," I remarked.

"No; '74 was the year the Mulligan lot went with the
pleuro; and '75 was the year Ramsay's punt went down
with my wagon and things. In Dick's year a contractor
named Pribble had got a wagon made to order in 
Melbourne; it cost over a hundred notes delivered at Hay.
Best bit of furniture I ever saw -- front wheels five foot;
hind wheels six foot; three-and-a-half axles all round. He
bought twenty-two bullocks, with their tackle, for one
hundred and forty notes -- good frames, but very poor -- to
take the wagon out back with stores, but just then he
got a chance of going into land, so he offered me the lot
for one hundred and eighty. It was a gift at the money,
and Pribble was a quiet decent fellow, so I found all
manner of fault with the plant, and beat him down five
notes before I froze on. Fact I stuck out for his wife's
side-saddle into the bargain, till at last he lost patience and
told me to go to hell. Worst thing about respectability
is the infernal meanness it drives you into.

"I intended to go down to the Murray where there was
no end of grass, and fatten up the new lot and freshen my
own team, and turn out two tip-top twenties next season,
without buying another hoof. I could see my way to an
independence while I was young enough to get some good
of it; and more than that, I could see my way to Agnes in
a more manly, off-hand way than depending on the sort<pb n="67"/>
of crooked maginnis I had on her. All cut and dried -- 
everything right for Providence to have a look in.

"As soon as I bought this plant, two middling good men
offered themselves as drivers -- Blathering Billy and Dick
the Devil; and I unfortunately engaged Dick. Just then
M'Culloch stuck me up, to take six ton of wire to Boolka,
with five ton of locks and pieces guaranteed for the return.
So we loaded the wire on the new wagon, and after some
consultation, Dick took my eighteen daisies and started for
Boolka, while I fell back on the Murray with my 
twenty-two thin bullocks and my original wagon. In fact, I was
too anxious to get back to the Murray. I gave Dick twelve
notes to pay his way till we should meet on the Murray;
then he started north and I started south. That was my
share."

"You don't mean to say he absconded with the lot?"
exclaimed the trapper.

"Well, no, only as far as the Tooriganny. As soon as
my back was turned he began to circulate the report that
he had bought the whole plant from me at the last
moment, and he showed everybody my receipt for two
hundred and eighty notes for the team and wagon and
twenty notes for the horse -- the best carriers' hack in
Riverina, bar none. Dick was a well-connected, 
well-educated fellow, and he showed letters he was supposed
to have got from some relation in England, with a 
remittance of four hundred notes. Everybody believed him, for
he was always talking about remittances. When you hear
a man talk about remittances, have nothing to do with him.
You can't touch him without losing by him.

"However, at the Tooriganny, Dick fell in with three
brothers, name of Durham, from the Queensland border -- 
very decent chaps, I believe -- and he sold them everything
except the horse. But the blasted scum thought there might
be some hitch about the load, so he gave the Durhams to
understand that the trip belonged to me, and that he had
bought the plant conditionally on delivering the wire on
my account. Of course this sounded well, so the Durhams<pb n="68"/>
delivered the load, and posted the receipt to me at Echuca.
I got the money a week or two after my little chat with
Cameron. Properly speaking, that was my share."

"Why didn't you foller him up?" asked the harsh voice
of the kangaroo hunter.

"And didn't I follow him up? I was at Barmah when
I heard the news, and I paddocked the twenty-two bul-
locks with a selector and left the wagon at his place; then
I took the train to Deniliquin, and the coach to Hay, and
bought a horse there, and rode five solid weeks, with a
revolver under my coat-tail. I went through three good
horses altogether, and spent every copper I had, besides
going in debt, -- and all for nothing. I didn't see him for
more than two years afterwards; he was with a 
sheep-drover then, and looked miserable enough, poor 
unfortunate dog. And to mend matters, when I got back to
Barmah, I found four of my skeletons dead of pleuro, and
eight dying, and the selector cursing me up hill and down
dale for infecting his place. Another retreat from Moscow."

"Well, there's no denyin' but Dick acted (adv.) dirty
that time," remarked Dixon, as he drew his line from the
water. "Course, I was sort o' sorry for you, seein' a man
never knows when his own (adj.) turn'll come. Anyhow,
it fetched a curse on poor Dick; got a look on him ever
since like a hunted devil. Fact is, it ain't worth while for a
man to make a (adj.) rogue of his self without he gets at
somebody able to afford it. (Adj.) crawfish has et my bait
off. Must go an' roast another, I s'pose."

"I'm glad I didn't catch him when my temper was up,"
pursued Thompson, as Dixon climbed the bank. "I'd have
shot him on sight. Poor Dick! Nice, jovial, kind-hearted
chap, and full of feeling for dumb animals, but not worth
a curse to stand temptation. And that transaction did fetch
a thing on him that he'll never shake off. You should see
him now. But it was partly my own fault. I should have
steered clear of a man that talked about remittances. 
However, that's my love-story, and short as it is, it covers my
whole life. No more romance for me. Certainly there's an<pb n="69"/>
oldish girl in Moama that I could fall in love with if I let
myself loose, but that would be madness for a man in my
position. Anybody else might live in hope, but I don't;
for the Providence that knows how many hairs a man's got
on his head will take thundering good care I don't get off
so cheap. I'll live and die on the wallaby. I'm like that 
character in the Bible -- I forget who he was -- always going to
and fro on the earth, and walking up and down in it. I've
got the satisfaction of knowing that I deserve it all."

## CHAPTER XIV


- Enter Lucifer, as a priest.
- {:.indent-6}Longfellow's *Golden Legend*.
{:.poetry}

"Mournful is thy tale, son of the car," I observed, 
thriftlessly using up a good quotation from Ossian. "But you're
only passing through the cycle of adversity that every
novelist-hero has to fulfil. You'll meet your antithetical
affinity yet,-- some woman with the curse of prosperity on
her; and such a woman's alkali, chemically combined with
your acid, will fill the goblet of life with a delectable
fizzer. Why, this afternoon, when old Fritz spoke of your
catching a thirty-pounder, I thought at once, from what
I knew of you, that he was referring to some heiress.
You'll be a shire-councillor, -- possibly a churchwarden, --
before you're done; and one that knows the law, go to;
and a rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath
had losses, go to; and one that hath two gowns, and 
everything handsome about him. You'll be a man of acres -- like
Binney, over there -- with a good-natured toleration for the
lower classes."

"I don't thank you for the compliment, though Binney's
a ten-to-one better man than I am," interrupted 
Thompson, contentiously. "I'm Berryite to the bone; and Binney's
tarred with the same stick as yourself -- with this difference,
that he's a sound Conservative, and you're a rotten one.
He's a good, honest pillar of Conservatism; and you're a
sepulchre, whitewashed with Conserv--"

"Is that you, Thompson?" inquired a cheerful voice from
the top of the bank.

"What's left of me," replied the bullock driver, "Mr
Binney."<pb n="71"/>

"Stay where you are, Thompson. All fishing? You'll
have company, Harold. Why, Collins, is this you?"

"No," I replied, and shook hands with the two 
cloud-dropped visitors. Binney was a special friend of mine; a
farmer, living just beyond the pub. Harold Lushington, a
young Methodist minister, was Binney's brother-in-law. I
introduced them to the Colonel, inadvertently omitting
(something like me) to mention Lushington's profession.

"I heard this afternoon that you were camped here,"
said Binney to Thompson, "so I just came over to tell you
that I want to send away a couple of hundred bags of
barley if you'll take it at the current rate. Will you call
round tomorrow morning? Right. We'll leave it till then.
Harold is on business, too. When he was down at the post
this afternoon the old German told him some fish-yarn, and
it takes a very small touch to put him off his head on that
subject."

"What bait are you using, Collins?" asked Lushington.
"I have supplied myself with sheep's lungs."

"No good," remarked Thompson. "Dixon'll give you a
roasted mussel if you don't mind going up to the fire for it."

"Thanks," replied the young clergyman; and he hastily
climbed the bank.

"Now, I don't want to interrupt you, boys," said Binney,
who had seated himself on a root. "Go on with your 
conversation, if it's not private. You were talking of 
Conservatism, I think."

"The subject of politics was casually glanced at, I
remember," replied the Major, "but our topic was the
romance of life -- the love-story. We had been listening to
a most interesting experience of this kind, and my mind
had just reverted to a speculation touching a very worthy,
though somewhat profane, friend of ours -- now gone to
prepare a bait. I was busied in conjecture as to what phase
the grand passion would be likely to assume in his case.
For we must by no means suppose that his unconventional
address and seventh-century moral culture have 
emancipated him from the common thraldom or tended to make<pb n="72"/>
him the exception which is erroneously supposed to prove
the rule."

I noticed the respectful air which Binney unconsciously
assumed under the glamor of the Judge's perfect 
enunciation and measured rhetoric. But Thompson nagged in
reply:

"You're doing the chap a great injustice, Rigby. Though,
to be sure," he added sadly, "there's so much injustice in
the world that a little here or there makes no difference.
Anyway, Dixon's not to blame for being rough-and-ready;
and he lives up to his standard as well as you live up to
yours, and better than I live up to mine. And he's no such
half-savage as you want to make out. Willoughby could
tell you that."

"You must know," I explained to Binney and the
Colonel, "this Willoughby was a whaler of the 
scholarly-aristocratic type, placed by an inscrutable decree of 
Providence in the position of understudy to Dixon during the
last wool season. Dixon and Willoughby must have got on
well together, Steve?"

"They did, indeed," replied Thompson. "They were
together for over three months, and their friendship grew
stronger every day."

"This accounts for Dixon's smattering of the classics?"
I suggested.

"Ay, he's a bit aggravating that way," conceded 
Thompson, reluctantly. "He's mad on it. He has a dictionary in
his wagon, that he bought for the sake of the Latin phrases
at the end. Willoughby used to be posting him up day
and night, and everything he learned stuck to him -- not
like me. It was the fun of the world to Willoughby. Dixon
naturally washered up his phrases with a "bloody" or two
to make them sound sort of free-and-easy, and Willoughby
made him believe it was exactly what was wanted. 
However, at the present time, if you were to ask Dixon who,
of all his acquaintances, stands highest in his liking, I'll
wager anything he would say Willoughby, and if you
were to ask Willoughby the same question he would say<pb n="73"/>
Dixon. Strange, isn't it, when you come to compare the
men? But they were both open-minded chaps, and each
found a lot to respect in the other. I can speak positively
about this, for Dixon and I travelled together from 
Nalrooka to Hay, just before Willoughby left. Willoughby's
one of the nicest coves I ever met; and he can no more
help his own infernal uselessness than Dixon can help his
own infernal ignorance. I've seen the two of them lying on
their backs for hours together, looking at the stars, and
Willoughby trying to learn Dixon astronomy. Then, again,
I've seen Dixon doing all he could to make a man of
Willoughby; but they both had too many rings on their
horns, and the teaching glanced off. However, if there had
been any nastiness about Dixon, or any super -- super -- dash
it! super --"

"Say manager, Steve," I suggested.

"-- ciliousness," proffered the General.

"Yes, that's the very word -- any superciliousness about
Willoughby, they would have quarrelled and parted the
second day instead of living like brothers for three months,
and then parting with real regret. I went with them to the
railway station to see Willoughby off. Worst thing about
it was that, though they couldn't improve one another,
they infected one another. Willoughby took Dixon's style
of swearing with him for a keepsake, and left Dixon his
style of slapping Latin in people's faces. Hanged if I know
which habit is the worst."

"Where did Willoughby go?" I asked.

"To Sydney. He's in an insurance office now. Dixon
persuaded him to write respectfully to a Mr Wilcox that
he knew; so a friendly correspondence grew up, and this
Wilcox offered him a billet where, according to his own
account, his duty consists in being the nephew of an 
English baronet. Wilcox is one of the directors. So Willoughby
went back to Sydney with some *eclat*, and no need to deny
himself any of the little requirements of a gentleman. It
cost Dixon over forty notes to put him through."

"Does Dixon advertise this?" I asked.<pb n="74"/>

"Now, wouldn't it be like him? Don't judge everybody
by yourself. I'm pretty intimate with him, but I wouldn't
know anything about that part of the business only for
reading a long letter he got from Willoughby, as we came
through Echuca the other week."

"And you read Dixon's private letters?" said I austerely.
"Oh, you skunk!"

"Simply because Willoughby writes such a scholarly
hand that Dixon doesn't know which is top or bottom,
though he has learned himself to make out any sort of
plain writing, if the words are not too long. I'm not 
justified in telling all this, but you fellows drove me to it. And
I don't see why Dixon shouldn't have a romance in his
life as well as anybody else. Now that I come to think of
it he *has* one. The scene of it was on the Goulburn, twenty
or thirty miles from here, and the girl was a State School
teacher. She was boarding at the farm where Dixon 
paddocked his bullocks when he was pontooning logs five or
six years ago. I don't know how it ended, but the 
beginning was romantic enough for anything."

"You whet our curiosity, Steve," remarked the Major,
as Lushington came down the bank and selected a 
convenient seat.

"Your friend kindly gave me the bait he had prepared
for himself," explained the clergyman to Thompson as he
threw his line into the water.

"Of course," replied Thompson. "However, as to this
love-story. It seems that one Saturday when there was no
school, this Miss Coone -- that was the girl's name -- was out
with the youngsters of the farm gathering flowers."

"Gathering flowers is good, but hackneyed," interposed
the Colonel critically. "It dates from the abduction of
Persephone."

"----and Dixon was drawing up to the river with a log,
but not in sight of the girl, on account of a belt of 
whip-stick scrub, when suddenly he heard a scream."

"Decency, Steve," said I. "That scream is older than the
*Iliad*. Behold, it is written in the Book of Jasher."<pb n="75"/>

"Have you done?" asked Thompson coldly. "As I was
saying, he heard a scream."

"And saw the girl struggling in the grasp of two 
bushrangers," rejoined the Senator. "Yes, go on."

"No, I'm d--d if I do. Tell the story yourselves to
your own satisfaction."

"Well, you are a polite pair," remarked Binney.

"It was a most remarkable thing, and a good deal talked
about at the time," continued Thompson, turning toward
the last speaker. "There was about an acre of smooth 
tableland, ending in a steep bank, and the river below. Not a
safer-looking place in the country, and this Miss Coone
and three or four youngsters were scattered about 
gathering flowers, and they had a basket pram with the youngest
kid asleep in it standing in the middle of the open. It was
a beautiful calm day, I believe, but a sudden gust of wind
caught the hood of the pram and whirled the whole 
concern, baby and all, straight for the steep bank. Of course
the teacher gave a scream and after it full lick. 
Providentially, Dixon was close handy, and, in spite of these 
unmannerly animals, he heard the scream and went. He could
do his hundred yards in eleven or twelve seconds those
times, and I don't suppose that trip took him much longer,
boots and all. He just saw the pram toppling over the
bank, and he overtook the girl, and flung her back, and
the next moment he went head foremost into the river.
It was a fat baby, like they generally have on farms,
and it floated like a cork, so he had it out in no time. Then
he snaked out the pram and pillows and things, and went
back to his team. The people at the farm made a hero of
him for the time, but whether Miss Coone actually fancied
him, or whether it was a sort of gratitude, or whether she
was taken with him as a novelty, I can't say. I believe she
was a city-bred girl and polished at that."

(Faint praise. She was a poem. I met her afterwards.
But that, saving your patience, is yet another romance.)

"And in good time here comes the noble duke," said I,
"We'll make him finish the story."
<pb n="76"/>

"Very well," replied Thompson, "and though I know
no more than I've told you, I venture to say the 
to-be-continued is as much to his credit as the beginning."

"Good evening to you," said Binney civilly as Dixon
passed him, descending the bank.

"Same to you, boss, if you was the divil hisself," replied
the bullock driver with equal courtesy. "What's on the
(adj.) blackboard now?"

"Well," replied Thompson, "we were talking about that
school-mistress of yours over here on the Goulburn and
wondering whether she was gone on you or you on her."

"Case o' *mutuus* (adj.) *consensus*" returned Dixon
genially. "Six o' one and half-a-dozen o' the other. Used to
fancy myself a bit then. Used to make the (adj.) silk roar
like (sheol) them times. Used to be the gaudiest man on
the (adj.) river. *Non sum qualis* (adj.) *eram*. Gittin' a
sensible ole person now."

"In the name of incongruity, Collins, what have we
here?" whispered Lushington, whose seat was adjacent
to mine.

"Knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a thatched
house," I replied. But the young clergyman's unappreciative
silence showed that he regarded my answer merely as
ungrammatical and heathenish.

- Ursula! thy words may shame us,
- Yet we once were counted famous,
- *Morituri, salutamus*,
- {:.indent-2}*Aut victuri, te!*
- {:.indent-6}Gordon's *Ashtaroth*.
{:.poetry}

"Tell us the yarn, Dixon," said Thompson.

"Well, there ain't much yarn about it. Sort o' (adv.)
well missed fire. Grand bit o' goods she was, too! Knowed
grammar, an' jography, an' sums, an' every (adj.) thing.
Gosh! she was *facilis descensus* -- no, that ain't it; but it's
on the tip of my tongue -- she was *facile* (adj.) *princeps*.
Well, as I was tellin' you, it didn't come off. Couldn't hit
it, no (adj.) road."

"What broke it off?" asked Thompson.

"A (adj.) dance."

"You wanted her to go to a dance, and she wouldn't go?"
conjectured the Sheriff.

"Yes, she did go. I (adv.) well wanted her to go, and she
(adv.) well did go."

"And you parted on that?"

"Yes; you see, I got a black eye."

"What did she hit you with?" I asked

"Hit me? That wasn't her (adj.) style. Tell you how it
come. I goes into the (adj.) township, and strolls into a
billiard room, an' the marker he was playin' billiards, or
bagatelle or some (adj.) thing with another feller; an' the
other feller he was a (adj.) weed to look at; an', in the
course o' conversation, he says,

" 'Cannon!' says he. An' the marker he says,

" 'No, it ain't,' says he.

" 'Yes, it is,' says the telegraft feller."<pb n="78"/>

"Which telegraph feller?" asked Thompson.

"Which would you (adv.) well think? How many 
telegraft fellers was in the contract? Why the (sheol) don't
you lis'n? An' the telegraft feller he turns to me, an' says
he,

"'Ain't it a fair cannon?' says he.

"'No, it ain't,' says I. (Course, I didn't know a cannon
from Adam.)

"'Oh, yes it is,' says he.

"'You're a (adj.) liar,' says I.

"'What!' says he, an' with that he hauls off. Put the
(adj.) stuns on me."

"Where did he get you, Dixon?" I asked.

"Smeller," replied the narrator. "Well, I ain't used to
sich rough (adj.) company, an' I never bin hit but once
before this time, an' once since. Anyhow, my principle is
to take the meanest (adj.) advantage I kin git -- an' to take
it *quick*, for the sake of peace and quietness. But this little
(individual) seemed to want spankin' more nor squashin',
so I goes for him bare-handed, an' he fetches me right
(adv.) bang on the peeper. I follers him up 
ropeable -- gosh! he was like a (adj.) eel; an' he lands me fair on the
point; I drops like a cock, jumps up agen, an' goes for him
lemons. No (adj.) use. He gits home on the butt o' the lug
this time. I drops agen, an' rolls under the (adj.) billiard
table.

"'Come out o' thet, you dem scoundrel!' says he.

" 'I'll see you in (adj. pandemonium) fust,' says I. 'I ain't
comin' out till you clear off,' sez I. 'I give you the (adj.)
scon,' says I."

"Big man in small compass," suggested Binney.

"Fair science frowned not on his humble birth," I 
rejoined.

"Deceivin'est little (person) ever I dropped across,"
continued Dixon, with a touch of enthusiasm. "Grand
thing to be a (adj.) snag like him. Sort o' gift. Gosh! he
was there. *Volens et* (adj.) *potens*."

"And this painful incident disqualified you as a suitor?"<pb n="79"/>
conjectured Rigby. "You and the lightning-jerker were
rivals, I presume; and the spoils went to the victor?"

"None but the brave," I suggested.

"He never seen the gurl in his (adj.) life, so fur as I
know. But we parted that night through a (adj.) dance.
Fond o' dancin', Rigby?"

"Any man who wants a run for his money must prefer
any other folly," replied the Deacon, disagreeably. "I have
some little toleration for drunkenness, and gambling, and
so forth, but one must draw the line somewhere, and I draw
it at dancing."

"And do you think," said I, "that, because you are
vicious, there shall be no more 'promenard', and 'change
partners'?"

"Oh, shut up, both of you," growled Thompson. "Never
mind them, Dixon. Go on with your yarn."

"They ain't annoyin' me. But as I was tellin' you, it was
on'y a sort o' silver-weddin' dance at the 'joinin' farm; an'
the whole (adj.) lot o' us was ast; an' her ladyship was
lookin' forrid to it like goin' to heaven -- flyin' roun' like a
dog off o' the (adj.) chain."

"And you wouldn't go?" suggested Thompson.

"Yes, I *would* go, (verb) you. Didn't I scoot to the
(adj.) township to git a new set o' leadin' harness, an' when
I come back, says she,

"'What the (adj. Gehenna) have you bin doin' with
yer eye?'"

"Were those her words, Dixon?" asked Furlong, gravely.

"Well, it's five or six years ago, an' I don't s'pose a man
kin make sure o' bein' *ipsissima* (adj.) *verba*, as the sayin'
is."

"Very true," I interposed. "*That's* all right. How did
you account for your eye?"

"Well, I jist told her, plain an' straightforrid, I told her
three Cousin Jacks manhandled me in the (adj.) township,
an' while I was beltin' two o' them, the other (fellow)
he hove a brick an' landed me on the (adj.) eye."<pb n="80"/>

"And you told her you couldn't take her to the dance on
that account?" prompted the Judge.

"Wrong. It was her spoke. She said she didn't see what
the (adj. Avernus) I wanted goin' in sich company."

"But, Dixon," I remarked, "you see, your own excuse
laid you open to that retort. You might, for instance, have
told her that you saw a fellow morticing posts, and you
good-naturedly took his axe for a few minutes, and omitted
to dodge the core."

"Or," said the Deacon, "you might have told her you
saw a woman winding a bucket of water from a well, and
you gallantly offered your services, but she let go the
handle before you had a proper hold."

"Well, Satan'll have a hard choice among you three,"
muttered Thompson. "But how did things go then, Dixon?
What did you say to her?"

"Well, I up and says, 'Oh, it's no (adj.) odds,' says I,
'I kin see to dance, anyhow.'

"'Like (Tophet!) says she. 'Why, d--n my rags,' says
she, 'you ain't fit to be seen at a (adj.) dog-fight. Think
I'd go with you?' says she.

"'Do the other (adj.) thing, then,' says I, gammonin' to
fire up. 'Stop at home', says I.

"'I'll see you in (adj. Phlegethon) fust,' says she. 'I'll
jist go.' An' so she did. She went."

"Dear, dear," murmured Lushington. "This is 
dreadful."

"You're right, young feller," replied Dixon cordially.
"So you didn't go?" suggested Thompson.

"How the (adj. Abyss) could I go when she told me
not to? My feelin's is a (adj.) sight too fine for that lot.
But I'll tell you what (verbed) the (adj.) contract. I'd jist
bin through *Jane Eyre* along of another feller, name of
Jack Whitby, an' I'd come to the (adj.) conclusion that
clever, edicated gurls doesn't believe in a (adj.) walk-over.
They want a bit o' bullyraggin'. They (adv.) well like it.
I read a book once, where a toff-gurl, name o' Florence,
used to nag at her bloke, o' purpose for him to show her she<pb n="81"/>
wasn't goin' to wear the (adj.) breeches. Let a man be a
man, not a (adj.) monkey, that's their idear. On'y, 
sometimes it don't work properly. *Varium et mutabile semper*
(adj.) *foemina*." He paused and sighed. "Anyhow, I was
moochin' about the door, waiting for her when the 
corroboree was over, an' our people they walked on ahead, an'
me an' her we follered in the dark, an' not a word out o'
me till we got half-road; then it was hammer-an'-tongs."

"You expostulated with her?" suggested the General.

"Not me. That ain't my (adj.) style. But I argied like
(Acheron.) Fust she says,

"'Well,' says she, 'done actin' the (adj.) goat?'

"'You ain't goin' to no more dances, jist for this (adj.)
lot,' says I.

"'Indeed,' says she, 'an who the (adj. Townsville) do
you think you're talkin' to?' says she.

" Ain't you gone fur enough?' says I, lettin' on to git
wild. Ain't you (adv.) well frightened?'

"'(Tartarus) sweat the frightened,' says she. 'Strikes me,
you're the person that's in the (adj.) crush. You ain't my
boss; so you needn't be gittin' yer (adj.) wool off,' says
she.'"

"Oh, dear, dear," moaned Lushington.

"'Who the (inferno's) gittin' their (adj.) wool off?'
says I. 'Not me. But you ain't goin' to no more dances,'
says I.'

"'I'll go if I (adv.) well like,' says she.

"'Say that agen,' says I.

"'Think I ain't game, you (adj.) morepoke?' says she. 
'Well, I'll go if I (adv.) well like.'

"So with that I ketches holt of her by the arm, an' fetches
her a couple o' piccaninny kicks -- not enough to hurt a
(adj.) muskeeter. Mere matter o' form."

"Had again," muttered Thompson resentfully. "You
uncivilised animal; you're just about fit to associate with
remittance men."

"Jis' so," replied Dixon, with a touch of bitterness, most
unusual in his tone. "Course, you know a (adj.) sight more'n<pb n="82"/>
the blokes that writes books. So do I -- when it's too late.
You know a (Hades) of a lot about edicated gurls."

"He thinks he does," said I. "But what did Parthenia
do when you admonished her?"

"Ain't hardly fair to give her the name of a racehorse,
Collins," protested Dixon, with spontaneous delicacy.
"What did she do? Well, she sort o' sulked. Gurls is (adv.)
pig-headed if they take the notion, an' when she took the
notion, twenty bullocks wouldn't shift her. We'd a got on
beautiful if I'd stuck to my own (adj.) idear -- but it wasn't
to be. I always said it was cowardly to be nasty to a
woman or a kid, an' I consider the stinkin'est (adj.) thing
a man kin do is to welt a woman. Dunno how the (adj.
Malebolge) he kin ever look his self in the face agen. Ain't
that your idear about it, Collins?"

"Depends on the woman herself," I replied judicially. "I
agree with you in respect of the thin, bony subject, but a
plump, cushiony woman seems to invite beating."

"I am surprised that you should justify such a barbarism
in any case, Collins," interposed Lushington, warmly.

"Anyhow," continued Dixon, "I should a backed my own
(adj.) fancy, an' let Mister (adj.) Rochester go to
(Cocytus) with his bullyraggin'. Too late now."

*Nusquam tuta fides*, Dixon," remarked Rigby, 
sympathetically.

"Hum," replied the bullock driver, in non-committal
acknowledgment of the comment. "Gosh! I could a said
prayers to that piece, like a Jew to a graven image, only I
wouldn't bemean my (adj.) self. So, as I was tellin' you,
we walks on home, an' never another (adj.) word we
speaks, from that day to this. Never as much as 
'Good-bye' or 'Go to (Niffelheim)' when I was comin' away for
good. Hated the (adj.) sight o' me. *Aut amat aut odit*
(adj.) *mulier*. That's the (adj.) conclusion I've arrove at,
Rigby. Think I'm fur out?"

"You have the key to the situation, Dixon. But you
hove many a sigh when the disappointment glode across
your memory?"<pb n="83"/>

"Most unlikely," said I. "My impression is that he merely
wunk the other eye, and smole philosophically whenever
he thunk of his escape from bondage."

"Ever hear what became of Miss Coone afterward?"
asked Thompson.

"Well, yes," sadly replied the unfairly penalised 
life-racer. "I'm always sort of foxin' round for news about
her, in a careless (adj.) frame o' mind, an' now an' agen I
hear how she's gittin' on. Mostly through Woods' people,
for she keeps writin' to Mrs Woods, an' Woods' eldest boy
is in a store at Hay. Met ole Woods just this side of
Echucar, as he was coming through the other day, and he
told me the last (adj.) news was she'd bin shifted from
two half-times, on the Divil's River, to a provisional on
the Wimmera, an' the next word he says was, 'Now,
Dixon, don't you (adv.) well forgit to call round and see
the little child that --' Yes, real nice ole bloke, decent
fambly -- must take a spin over, some of these (adj.) 
Sundays." He paused, then resumed, thoughtfully.

"Yes, she'll be (adv.) well gittin' married to some 
member of Parliament yet, I shouldn't wonder. If things had
went middlin' right between me an' her, I might a bin
that (adj.) member o' Parliament myself!"

And so Dixon's romance petered out to a lame and by
no means logical conclusion.

## CHAPTER XVI

- Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
- {:.indent-6}*Troilus and Cressida*, Act IV, Scene v.
{:.poetry}


All individual meditations on Dixon's story were 
forestalled by the Senator, who straightway opened an address,
speaking in that oracular style which Thompson and I
recognised as portending a steadfast resolution to inflict
counsel on everyone within range. My own thoughts had
already reverted to Miss Vanderdecken; hence I listened
with some apprehension, for the masterful intonation of
Rigby's deep voice was gone and the faultless accents were
low and sad.

"Romance everywhere, hardening into tragedy, as the
real supersedes the fanciful; for the real is always tragic,"
said he gravely. "Comedy is tragedy, plucked unripe.
Farce is the grimmest of all tragedy; it is the blind jollity
of an Irish wake, with the silent guest none the less present
because unassertive. There are eight of us here tonight, and
probably seven of the number are more or less abject and
trashy heroes of romance -- romance which has ended, or
will yet end, in tragedy."

"Don't talk like that, Colonel," said I, with an 
involuntary shiver, as my thoughts flashed two hundred miles
northward.

"You're not the odd man out, I'm most happy to remind
you," said Thompson aside to me.

"The Lord reward you, Steve."

"He means himself, right enough," suggested Thompson.

"Not he, his mind is full of his own romance. I only hope
it won't overflow in an unbecoming way."

During this whispered colloquy, the Deacon continued<pb n="85"/>
speaking in even a graver tone. "I was much impressed this
afternoon by the last act, though not the last scene, of a
saddening life tragedy which long ago on the other side of
the globe opened as love's young dream." (Now, after all,
thought I, is he going to entertain a random audience with
such a story as that for the sake of pointing a moral?) "All
the details of the drama happen to be within my 
cognisance," he went on. "It is not for your entertainment that
I shall unfold them now, but in order that you may be
set thinking for yourselves and thinking in the right
direction."

"Oh, give the love-story a rest," I broke out with 
pardonable rudeness. "Let each of us tell the meanest thing he
ever did, or the wickedest, or the silliest -- anything but
a love-story with a sermon hooked on behind."

"Let Mr Rigby go on, Collins," said Binney. "Don't
change the topic while you can keep up anything like
Dixon's standard."

"Don't pay any attention to Tom," remarked 
Thompson. "He only wants to follow suit himself. His love-story
is a live one -- not like Dixon's or mine. You'll hear some
version of it from anyone you meet in Riverina, and the
only point they all agree upon is that the other party
clings to Tom like a mortgagee, though she's the haughtiest
subject on the plains."

"Probably that's as near the truth as a man of your moral
dimensions can get, Steve," I replied severely. "But if I
happen to be the somewhat measly object of a woman's
misplaced devotion, am I to parade her loyalty publicly and
make it the text of my homilies? Of course, this doesn't
touch your case, nor Dixon's, but would it be the right
thing for me? Why, I couldn't even bring myself to
pronounce her name before all hands. It would seem like
sacrilege."

There, thought I, surely that's broad enough.

"I apologise for the whole company, Mr Rigby, as I had
a share in interruption," said Binney. "A story that you
think worth telling must certainly be worth hearing."
<pb n="86"/>

"Oh, don't expect anything sensational," replied the
Major. "Moreover, the fact that the leading character is not
more than half-a-mile from us at the present moment brings
an objectionable element of personality into the story;
hence it must be taken as related, so to speak, under protest,
and only for the sake of the moral which will become 
apparent. Experience is said to be the best school, and if you
can avail yourselves of the experience of others, there is
certainly a point gained. Further, though each of you
may appear old to himself, you all appear young to me in
a mental sense especially, and I feel it incumbent upon
me to give you something to carry away from this 
accidental forgathering." (Hopeless, thought I. One never knows
where this class of moralist may break out. Why, already
that woman with her lovely face and truthful eyes is holy
even to a promiscuous acquaintance like me, and what
should she be to him?) "Very well," continued Rigby,
"picture to yourselves a young --"

"Hang it, I don't mind if I do tell my love-story, after
all," I interrupted, too hastily to get out of the rut of my
reading. "About a year ago, riding along a track through
one of the belts of scrub on Runnymede, I heard behind
me the clatter of hoofs blended with a woman's scream,
and the next instant a lady on horseback passed me like a
bird on the wing. I was startled to notice that the bit was
out of her horse's mouth, and a chill of horror came over
me as I thought of a tremendous precipice half a mile in
front. I darted forward at full speed, gaining stride by
stride, till at last by a desperate effort I drew abreast. Then
with one hand I lifted the lady from her saddle, and with
the other I wheeled my horse round in his own length.
The edge of the precipice crumbled away under his feet
as he turned, while the lady's horse went over. I heard the
dull, sickening thud as he found bottom far down in the
gorge, after I had pulled up. It was a near thing, but --"

"That'll do," interposed Thompson with chilling 
unresponsiveness. "Goliath himself couldn't carry out such
a contract, and a bolting horse always looks after himself,<pb n="87"/>
unless he has a vehicle behind him; and there's not six inches
deep of a precipice within a hundred mile of Runnymede.
That's the sort of yarn you'll tell when you get into
your dotage."

"This is hardly fair to Mr Rigby," protested the mild
voice of the trapper.

"So say I," rejoined Binney. "What's the matter with
you, Tom?"

"Now, Collins, like a good fellow," added Lushington.

"Go on, Judge," said I, perceiving that the whole 
conclave had fallen under the fascination of Rigby's palaver.
"I won't interrupt again. Nor will I listen."

And I didn't listen. The experience of monotonous
church services and interminable sermons in my boyish
days, and of noisy huts in maturer life had trained me to
enlist at pleasure Falstaff's faculty of hearing without
marking. So whilst Rigby's measured monologue went on I
switched off my auditory nerve system and heard only the
soft, sweet voice of the woman for whose sake I had
ineffectually acted the hog. It needed no effort to recall
her enchanting face, for every lineament was photographed
on the retina of my memory. Then, by a sequence which
it would be curious to trace, my mind drifted round to
Mrs Beaudesart. The women were in no way alike, save
that both were attractive to the eye, and both bore
evidence of that social cultivation which is every woman's
birthright; and would be every woman's inheritance if men
in name were men in reality. But Mrs Beaudesart, though
probably the younger of the two, had already gone through
three husbands, and now the most obscure member of her
little circle of friends was living in a state of perturbed
speculation as to whose turn would come next.

"You're doing it grand, Collins," said a low voice beside
me, and I felt that the Colonel had lived too long, for it
was Sam's hand that was laid warningly on my knee. "Sh-sh,
I don't want to let on I'm here," he continued, settling
himself comfortably in a hollow. Evidently, the boy was
solicitous only to avoid Rigby's observation, for almost<pb n="88"/>
any other member of our party might have perceived him
in the dark if his presence had been worth noticing.
"Didn't I hear Miss Vanderdecken say she wanted you
tonight?" I whispered, mentally crossing myself as the
tergiversation passed my lips.

"So she did," replied Sam, "but I'm on her business
now. Sort of aidy-conk, K.C.B. Rigby's got the flute, I
notice. Don't baulk him agen. He's worth a bob an hour to
lis'n to, judgin' by his style."

"-- takes a pride," continued the Deacon, "in tracing his
ancestry back to the third generation, where baronial
bastardy links his human nature with Olympian 
preeminence. He comes of a decayed family."

"Takes after 'em a bit, poor fellow," murmured Dixon
complacently. "What's his other (adj.) name?"

"Wetterliebenschaff. A good name; and Fritz inherited
the pride of his forefathers, along with the untiring 
purpose of his race. It has long been the custom in Germany
to train all boys to more or less useful trades, so that as a
rule every German is a specialist. Fritz, therefore, on 
leaving school served an apprenticeship of seven years; then
his term of military service --"

"What (adj.) trade did he learn?" demanded Dixon.

"Belt-maker," replied the Sheriff unsatisfactorily.

Dixon, though badly in the dark, was too well acquainted
with the guileful inveiglement of sells to seek further 
information. Rigby resumed, "Then three years in the 
standing army left him, according to the German idea, fit for
anything on earth. At what time he met with Wilhelmina
Ruttendammer, I don't exactly know --"

"Gosh! it was about time for *her* to git spliced anyhow,"
whispered Sam, somewhat shocked.

"-- but the romance was no doubt heralded by a scream
on the lady's part. At all events, they loved each other with
that calm, devoted, exclusive affection so much less liable<pb n="90"/>
to satiety and reaction than the restless passion which, I
take for granted, each of you fellows has experienced. Their
position in life conduced to love and fidelity. The bulk of
the German people, for sufficient reasons, are far from
rich; and Fritz's family was poor in Manasseh. His trade
was his fortune, which, in the language of the Fatherland,
means that he could eke out an existence by working twelve
hours a day, with a half-holiday every second Sunday; and
they have a proverb to the effect that if a man can't do a
day's work in twelve hours he can't do it at all. Mina,
whose face was her fortune, made a much poorer living by
working sixteen hours a day in a carpet factory, though
she also had each alternate Sunday afternoon to herself.
Therefore, she not only adored Fritz for his high descent,
but reverenced his relative opulence."

"Steady, steady; don't gloat over anybody's poverty,"
grumbled Thompson. Whilst he was speaking, a 
half-suppressed sigh broke from the little trapper. Rigby 
resumed, with marked complacency in his tone,

"Profit by their experience, boys. There is not a country
on earth incompetent to support its whole population in
easy comfort, nor is there a country able to sustain a
section of the community in extravagant luxury, and the
rest in bare decency. This applies to all ages, to all lands,
and to every degree of civilisation. The chapter of history
which records the suppression of the starving Jacquerie by
Gaston de Foix contains also a significant item to the effect
that this gallant gentleman kept sixteen hundred hunting
dogs for his own private delectation. Can you trace any
connection between the French packs of hounds and the
French packs of paupers? No, you have nothing to do
with history. Very well. Can you trace any connection
between British packs of hounds and British packs of
paupers in your own day? No; it's none of your business.
Very well. Then as surely as Touchstone's figure of
rhetoric is impregnable -- to wit, that drink being poured
out of a cup into a glass by filling the one doth empty the
other -- so surely shall you, in due time, be called upon to<pb n="91"/>
trace a connection between Australian packs of hounds,
and Australian packs of paupers. How often must I repeat
that if Job be permitted to own seven thousand sheep
and three thousand camels, with other property in 
proportion, the overwhelming majority of his fellow-sinners will
have to pluck up mallows by the roots and juniper bushes
for their food -- as per text. No state, no territory, however
bountifully endowed by Nature, however ably 
administered by man, will yield a superabundant dividend all round.
Excess will be balanced by deficiency, which is bad for
both poles of society, and therefore inimical to the 
progress of the race. Suppose you are told that there is a famine
somewhere, but your informant has forgotten the locality,
don't you at once conjecture India as the scene of the
trouble? And yet you know that India has been a current
proverb for wealth through more than two thousand
years. Well may you sing of India -- strictly, of Ceylon, it
amounts to the same -- as a place where every prospect
pleases and only man is vile. Vile he undoubtedly is, and
vile he will certainly continue, while his attitude invites
despoilment -- a proviso which escaped the well-bred 
contemplation of Heber. Of course, you're not responsible for
India; but, by Heaven, you're responsible for Australia!"

"Lis'n!" whispered Sam. "This bloke's an artist."

"So there was ample and evident reason for the poverty
of Fritz and Mina, but, like yourselves, they concerned
themselves only with the effect -- letting other people attend
to the cause. They were happy enough, as each alternate
Sunday afternoon left them at liberty -- in winter to walk
through the public galleries, or in summer to go on the
Spree in some cheap pleasure boat."

"Can't rise any pity for young couples with sich a
(sheol) of a (adj.) thirst on 'em," interposed Dixon, who,
being a strictly temperate man, naturally damned the sins
he'd not a mind to.

"Socio-political questions didn't trouble these 
soul-wedded lovers much," pursued the Colonel, politely 
ignoring Dixon's comment. "They went on their way, rejoicing<pb n="92"/>
in the true wealth of mutual affection, and earnestly 
discussing the great German problem."

"I understood you to say they didn't trouble themselves
with social politics?" remarked Binney.

"I say so still. The great German problem is black bread
and sauerkraut -- just as the great Australian problem is
rapidly resolving itself into mutton and damper."

"To hear you talk," I observed, "one would think the
great Australian problem was coming perilously near yam
and 'possum."

"So it is, Tom. Any more objections impending?"

"None. Proceed, good Alexander."

"Cripes! ain't he quick on the trigger?" whispered Sam.

"Our lovers had much to rejoice in," continued the
Major. "Apart from youth, health, and hatred to France,
they always had the satisfaction of seeing people much
poorer than themselves; so, like Paul, they thanked God,
and took courage. Moreover, the Providence which kindly
divides the responsibilities of life, so as to attain the
greatest good --",

"*Summum* (adj.) *bonum*" suggested Dixon, modestly.

"-- allotting extravagance to one section of the 
community, and thrift to another -- had met the interests of both
classes by pouring on Mina's head the negotiable blessing
of a superb crop of that pale golden hair which never goes
out of fashion. Altogether, the world went very well then."

"But so far as making a living's concerned, Mina might
as well have been bald," remarked Thompson, cautiously.

"So she was -- periodically," replied the Judge. "But a
few small silver coins go a long way toward tempering the
wind to the shorn girl. Try it. Bestow your own unlucky
hand, and your lacerated heart, upon some other and more
trustworthy Agnes, and the time will come -- it will assuredly
come, if not prevented -- when your daughters (to quote
from the Song of Solomon) will be 'like a flock of sheep,
that are even shorn'. They will learn to cheerfully forgo
every branch of culture except the external tillage of their
own heads -- the harvested crop being, of course, thriftily<pb n="93"/>
reserved for the thin-haired members of your plutocracy."

"Not while I can see along a gun-barrel," muttered
Thompson.

"But you won't be able to see along a gun-barrel, Steve,
after you've been bound hand and foot, and shunted into
outer darkness, on account of misconduct as a bailee of
your Lord's money. And your daughters -- barring 
intervention -- will humbly regard your plutocracy as a divinely
instituted sponge for the absorption of every desirable
thing the world can produce. Consider how many people
hold this view now."

"Mr Rigby, Mr Rigby," protested Lushington, "you do
the plutocracy an injustice. In point of fact, its office is to
spread the blessings of wealth."

"And how is this distribution to be carried out?" asked
Rigby, turning courteously toward the last speaker. "If
paid away as the wages of wealth-producing labor, the
tendency of our hypothetical capital will be to multiply
itself by itself, thus aggravating a social-economic 
discrepancy, already existing, and tacitly apologised for. If 
distributed by donation, the effect will be infinitely worse. Any
wealthy man, impelled to benevolence by human sympathy,
love of popularity, fear of hell, or what not, will tell you 
-- as several have told me -- that ninety per cent of the
money so apportioned does more harm than good. Now, I
am not impudent enough to dictate a course of action for
the man of wealth, nor a rule of reasoning for you, but I
wish to point out a remedial principle which has its root
in the moral constitution of our race."

"So like you, Commodore," I murmured.

"See here," pursued Rigby, unconsciously preserving
that insidious inflection of voice which gave his dogmatism
all the sweetness of flattery, "any act toward another person
has within it a soul, a certain idea or import, and it is upon
this idea, not upon the act itself, that the parties come in
touch. Aside from "presents", betokening esteem, or 
affection, or congratulation (see how tactfully we select the
term, Mr Lushington), most recipients, and some donors,<pb n="94"/>
are rightfully sensitive respecting the idea which may
inspire an act of benefaction. If the idea of sharing can be
preserved, the parties are brought abreast and mutually
elevated by the primitive virtue of the principle. Whereas,
the eleemosynary idea, interpreting a similar act, brings the
parties into contact vertically, not laterally, and the 
benefaction, materially good, is poisoned by its implication.
Philanthropists should learn the ever-true proverb that 'a
gift destroyeth the heart', and engineer their work 
accordingly. The idea of sharing, of participation, admits of 
indefinite extension, and never comes out amiss. Applied, in
spite of Individualism, to historical memories, to national
aspirations, to religious beliefs, to literary and other ideals,
it constitutes a bond stronger than actual kinship. And how
eagerly you avow this principle when an enemy is at the
gate! Therefore there is ample reason why sharing, not
giving -- irrespective of quantity in either case -- should be
the sentiment of bona fide Christianity, and that it is so
none but the most inveterate church-goer will deny --",

"Confine yourself to the case before the court, Sheriff,"
I interposed, shocked by Rigby's unconscious personality,
and dreading worse. "You were giving evidence *in re* Fritz
and Mina."

"And you may rest assured that our female descendants'
coiffures are in no danger," added Lushington, with clerical
humor.

"Let us see to it in time," replied the General, after a pause.

"We know that other populations were once as pompously
free as we are now; and we know that through ignorant
neglect of their own responsibilities and slavish toleration
of class encroachment, the wool of their female descendants
is in the market today. We know that, broadly speaking,
the Russian peasant of the seventeenth century was a 
freeman, and we know that his descendant of the nineteenth
century was a serf; and this without foreign incursion.
There was a time when 'Frank' meant 'freeman', just as
definitely as 'negro' meant 'black man', but another time
came when the Frankish widow gathered nettles for her
children's dinner, and the perfumed seignior -- also a Frank,
bear in mind -- had an alchemy whereby he extracted the
third nettle, and called it 'rent'. To come nearer home, we
know that the English peasant in Chaucer's time was much
better off than his descendant in Cowper's time, though
four centuries of material and intellectual progress lay
between. One thing, however, we don't know -- we don't
know where unbridled aggression would voluntarily
pause."

"And yet our British freedom has broadened down from
precedent to precedent," remarked Lushington.

"I fear it will be found," replied the Colonel, <pb n="96"/>
deferentially, "that the freedom to oppress is the only growth of
socio-political organisation which, in any race, at any time,
or under any form of government, has of its own accord
broadened down from precedent to precedent. Even in the
Hebrew theocracy, authorised levy and authorised 
dominion broadened down to the devouring of widows' houses
and the grinding of the faces of the poor, while the graces
and concessions of the Sabbatical and Jubilee years 
narrowed down till they went the way of all unguarded 
popular privileges. My own remote ancestor, the free Saxon
barbarian, who voted his chosen leader to the 
chieftainship, was represented in the time of Ivanhoe by a 
descendant wearing a brass collar, inscribed: 'Gurth, the son of
Beowulf, is the born thrall of Cedric.' How was this? Why,
Cedric's freedom had broadened down till it absorbed not
only Gurth's freedom, but Gurth himself."

"You're forgetting the Norman Conquest, Mr Rigby,"
suggested Lushington.

"A matter of indifference," replied the Major. "If the
Gurth of 1066 had been a freeman, Senlac would have
been a Marathon. Do you think Saxon England fell 
unwept, without a crime? No more than Poland, and the
crime was the same in each instance. What did it matter to
Gurth whether Saxon earl or Norman baron kept him
making bricks without straw? What will it matter to your
own grandchildren whether they toil and starve and
cringe under the Australian flag or under any other? There
was no Norman Conquest in France or Germany, but
there also Gurth relaxed his vigilance, and so bequeathed
perdition to his descendants. You see, I decline to take
advantage of the conspicuous fact that Cedric was as 
hopelessly Saxon as Gurth himself -- and heaven knows he was
Saxon enough for anything. By the way, the manual-labor
Saxon was helpless enough and servile enough under the
Saxon earl Leofric, a few decades before the Conquest.
But he hadn't always been so. There was a time when he
didn't polish up his brass collar to captivate the girls. Now
I want to draw your attention to a carefully-slurred truth,<pb n="97"/>
which is, that in the interval between the 11th century and
the 19th, between Senlac and Eureka, your human rights
didn't broaden down by any process of easy evolution into
your present limited citizenship. By no means. Each inch
of recovered ground cost a hundred lives, and very often
you paid the lives without recovering the inch. In 
obedience to that grand law which guarantees the sure recoil of
any redeemable race against aggression which has 
broadened down to the insufferable stage, you rose from time to
time, making some incoherent demand for restoration of
certain privileges which had strangely disappeared. You
were hanged for your trouble. You rose under Wat Tyler,
and you were hanged; under Cade, and you were hanged;
under Ket, and you were hanged. You rose again and again
under various interested agitators of more or less 
ignominious memory -- never demanding anything beyond partial
restitution of your own stolen rights, and you were
promptly and cheerfully hanged every time; but some
inch of lost ground was recovered with certain 
martyrdoms."

"Might draw it a bit milder," protested Dixon. "Ain't
hardly fair to allow that any of our (adj.) posterity was
ever hanged."

"True, Dixon. The honor is in reserve. Your posterity
will be hanged upon very slight pretext, as a punishment
for your present sin. Can't you see that the mere toleration
of a growing inequality is treason in the first degree, and
that some one must soon or later swing for it? Why should
you spend your life and your labor in tenderly rearing a
vampire to batten on the big toe of future generations?"

"Well, what the (adj. sheol) can we do?" asked Dixon
good-naturedly.

"What could my ancestor, the free barbarian Gurth, do?
What he *did* was exactly what you're doing now. He
obediently contributed his human birthright to the 
building up of Cedric's monopoly, and therefore succeeding
Gurths were hanged, mutilated, flogged, branded, and
slaughtered wholesale, merely for thinking they had any<pb n="98"/>
rights at all, and thinking too audibly. There. I challenge
all the orthodox clergy of Christendom to adduce a more
striking instance of the sins of the fathers visited upon the
children. What the expletive can you do? -- you ask. Why,
simply be a Christian. Let your whole life be a protest
against the system which aims at leaving a coming 
generation the miserable option of serfdom, suicide, or Sicilian
Vespers. But no, you prefer to follow the line of least
immediate resistance, Dixon. A mess of pottage -- sawdust
pottage at that and away goes your birthright. For this
choice, Paul calls you a 'profane person', and do you
think --"

"Well, he's barkin' up the wrong (adj.) tree," protested
Dixon. "I don't deny I'm a sort o' plain-spoken (person)
but I ain't profane. I know where to draw the (adj.) line."

"And do you think he regards your own perdition as a
feather in the scale, compared with your treason against
unborn generations? I tell you that from the present social
system of pastoral Australia -- a patriarchal despotism,
tempered by Bryant and May -- to actual lordship and 
peonage, is an easy transition, and the only thing that can
prevent this broadening down is a vigorous rally of every
man with a clear head and a heart in the right place."

"There's no denyin' that (adj.) lot," remarked Dixon,
in wise acquiescence. "Anythin' for a quiet life. Shove ahead
with Fritz and Minar. We're follerin', all right."

"Very good. I must endeavour to guard against these
discursions. Where was I? Yes. The course of true love
was running smoothly. Presently appeared a cloud in our
lovers' sky, but in the strictest sense of the word, it was
one with a silver lining. I think I have mentioned that Mina's
face was her fortune. A very good fortune it proved to be.
An old financier, Herr Moses Isaacstein, transgressed the
injunction of his namesake and lawgiver by making her an
offer of marriage. She, of course, thought of Fritz, and
claimed a fortnight for consideration. On the two available
Sunday afternoons, as well as on other occasions stolen
from sleeping-time, the lovers discussed their future <pb n="99"/>
prospects in the new light emanating from the Herr's proposal.
Here they found themselves confronted by an alternative
which involved the greatest of all principles. Both hearts
rung true to the touch; and their resolution was bravely
taken. What says Emerson?

- {:.indent-3}So nigh is grandeur to our dust,
- {:.indent-4}So close is God to man,
- {:.indent-3}When Duty whispers low, *Thou must*,
- {:.indent-4}The youth replies, *I can*
{:.poetry}

Like Costard, they smelt some envoy, some goose, in the
enterprise. In a word, they felt it absurd to love so much,
loved they not honor more. And their conception of
honor was as old as the economic disparity which Socialism
seeks to redress.

"So when Herr Isaacstein and Mina were joined in those
holy bonds which effectually cancel any little element of
impropriety associated with such unions, Fritz had no
thought of hanging either his harp or himself on a 
willow-tree. But with a Continental instinct of utilising things
that other people would waste, the young fellow availed
himself of the old fellow's jealousy to obtain a free passage
to Melbourne. And so they parted -- Fritz leaving his heart
with its idolised queen, while she sent hers across the
ocean with its incomparable king. Not even the 
consciousness of a duty nobly performed could make that parting
otherwise than heart-breaking. They knew that to each of
them the time had come when the prayer of morning would
be for night, and the nightly prayer for morning. Their
only happiness lay in the backward glance of memory, and
their only hope lay beyond the grave -- the grave in question
being, of course, that of Herr Isaacstein. In fact, poor
Mina's feelings might have found expression in a fine
Scotch song."

" Auld Robin Gray'," interposed Thompson, with that
bookish affectation which should have been cured by his
experience of the Standard Poetical Works. "I know the
song, it's by Lady Anne Lindsay --

- {:.indent-3}Young Jamie lo'ed me weel, and he sought me for his bride."
{:.poetry}

<pb n="100"/>

"Tut, no," interrupted the Colonel, in turn. "I mean,

- {:.indent-3}O, an ye were deid, Gudeman,
- {:.indent-4}Wi' a green turf on your heid, Gudeman,
- {:.indent-3}That I micht ware my widowheid
- {:.indent-4}Upon a rantin' Highlandman.
{:.poetry}

"However, the rantin' Highlandman -- such as he was -- 
reached these shores during that severe depression which
gradually lifted on the opening of the lands in '65. The poor
fellow had a hard enough time of it for the first year or two.
It is no light thing, let me tell you, boys, to be a stranger
in a strange land -- ignorant of the language and at your
wits' end to find any sort of work by which you can earn
your salt."

"But you said he had served a long apprenticeship as a
belt-maker," objected Thompson. "Couldn't he tackle
snobs' work?"

"He knew less of the process of boot-making than any
other man ever did. His experience lay entirely in soldiers'
belts."

"Then surely he might have got work in a saddler's
shop?"

"He had never seen a stitch put in. His trade was 
cutting-out. I think I spoke of him as a specialist. But he had one
solace that no hardship could take away. Through the
assistance of a friend in Berlin he kept up a correspondence
with Mina, who faithfully furnished him with bulletins of
her husband's health. Independently of this, Fortune seemed
at length to smile faintly on his meek persistence. He
obtained permanent employment as gardener's off-sider on
Tartpeena station, in the south-western district, and began
to save money. But Herr Moses hung out still."

{:.poetry}


"It happened that at this time I was in charge of a small
survey party," continued the Deacon, "and on Tartpeena
station I met Fritz for the first time. I had spent a few
months in his native city when I was a boy, and had 
afterwards made a futile attempt to learn the German language;
hence there was a silken thread of fellowship in the 
intercourse which sprang up between us. During the few
months that gave us occasional opportunity to enjoy each
other's society, I noticed three excellent qualities in Fritz -- 
one was his simple fidelity to Mina, another was a capacity
for thrift, unparalleled yet within my observation, and
the third was a patient, unwavering trust in Providence,
though Herr Moses was worth twenty dead men yet.

"In the spring of '65, as some of you may remember, all
the unalienated portion of Tartpeena was thrown open
for selection by lottery, and the pastoral tenant, Mr 
Goodfellow, made every effort to secure as much of the run as
possible. He lavished drinks and civilities on all the 
employees of his various stations, and as many other 
presumably reliable vermin as he could rake up. He sent these
jackals forth, thoroughly posted in the lion's interest, and
equipped with the lion's money, to seek the luck of that
roaring specimen who is said to look after his own. It is
difficult -- from a strictly moral point of view -- to imagine a<pb n="102"/>
shadier transaction, but easier to account for it. Thrift,
thrift, Horatio. Mr Goodfellow wished to provide for a
rainy day!"

"Now, you or I would have done the same thing, under
the same circumstances," protested Binney.

"I deny your major," replied Rigby. "But if we had
done it we would certainly have deserved to be jailed for
life, as enemies to the human race. Apply the final test -- 
the test of results. Look at the south-western district now
 -- partly unpopulated, partly rack-rented, and all alike 
unprogressive. What a collapse for Mitchell's well-named
Australia Felix -- the potential garden of the province. Better
be with the forgotten dead, Mr Binney, than be alive and
sharing in the responsibility for such a far-reaching abuse
of the national heritage."

"I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick;
nobody marks you," said I coldly. Not that I cared, of
course. But it was well-known to most of the audience that,
in time past, my Conservative principles had escorted me
through the somewhat devious and dirty ways of 
land-dummyism. Moreover, it was bad form on the Judge's part
to censure spoliation, or fraud, or corruption, in the 
presence of an avowed Conservative.

"It will remind Tom of old times," continued the
Colonel blandly, "when I explain that Fritz -- armed with
an area -- map whereon the allotments were numbered 
consecutively, according to their desirableness, and also with
£32 in cash for a first instalment -- got the third call, and
secured the mile-square block numbered 1 on his map.
The two first selections had been made by bona fide men,
who hadn't money enough to pay the shilling an acre on
this full-sized lot. As Fritz left the office, Mr Goodfellow
greeted him with enthusiasm. Fritz received his 
congratulations with freezing formality. Goodfellow mildly
reminded him of the understanding that existed between
them, and produced a blue paper about two feet long,
which he requested Fritz to sign. Fritz didn't remember
any understanding, and preferred to reserve his signature.<pb n="103"/>
This transaction, in point of shadiness, hotly rivals Mr
Goodfellow's own record, and is to be accounted for in
the same way. Thrift, thrift, Horatio. Fritz also wished to
provide for a rainy day -- particularly as Herr Isaacstein
was proving, like Major Bagstock, tough, sir, and devilish
sly.

"It is a big undertaking for an exceptionally useless man
to make a start on six hundred and forty acres with barely
fifty pounds, but Fritz did it. How he did it, heaven only
knows. Certainly, Providence, per medium of Mr 
Goodfellow, had franked him for the first half-year -- a good
illustration, by the way, of Mr Lushington's contention
that the office of the plutocracy is to spread the blessings
of wealth. I often went out of my way to see Fritz during
the steady progress of that herculean labor, and always
recognized in him the stuff that millionaires are made of.
When I complimented him on this -- as I frequently did -- 
he almost fell down and worshipped me. However, two or
three years passed; and Fritz received a letter which seemed
to prove beyond controversy the existence of a divinity
that shapes our ends, if we rough-hew them judiciously.
Herr Isaacstein had taken his departure to another, and,
let us hope, a better world. But you may be sure that the
question where Moses was when the candle went out didn't
trouble Fritz much. His interest was centred on the large
fact that, with the exception of a trifling fire-insurance
premium, bequeathed to the local synagogue, Mina 
inherited all the old gentleman's accumulations, amounting
to fifteen thousand thalers, or £2200 sterling. Owing to
some recent transactions of Herr Moses with an American
firm, this sum was only about one-half of what might have
been expected; nevertheless, the splendid sacrifice of our
lovers was by no means unrewarded. Indeed, as a set-off
against their cash loss they had the knowledge that the
worry of those transactions had materially hastened the
good man to his recompense.

"Germany being the only country fit for a man of
fortune to live in, Fritz offered his selection to Mr <pb n="104"/>
Goodfellow, at a price, and, after the usual nibbling and 
coquetting, the squatter paid him four pounds per acre for his
title. This would amount to £2560, or £360 more than
Mina's contribution, but Love is too blind to notice such
discrepancies. At all events, with this tidy little evidence of
his thrift and intelligence, Fritz returned to the 
Fatherland, arriving, I think, in the end of '68 or the beginning of
'69. His whole soul went forth in Lutheran appreciation of
the Providence which had moved in such a trustworthy
way, and which now seemed to be giving virtual guarantee
of continued fidelity to his interests.

"That is the end of the first chapter, boys. You may
discuss it while, with Dixon's permission, I prepare one of
his mussels for its appointed service in the scheme of the
universe." And so saying, the Major climbed the bank,
and disappeared.

We were silent for a minute or two -- not thinking over
the story, but listening to an intermittent sound which,
ever since the meeting opened, had been inviting attention.
Sometimes it resembled the shrill appeal of a pig caught in
a garden fence; then it would, perhaps, die away 
altogether, and presently rise like the melancholy dirge of a
disobedient child shut up in a store-room; then again it
would swell forth like the epithalamium heard by the
awakened sleeper in the dead, unhappy night, and when
the cat is on the roof. Sometimes it seemed to come from
the wagons behind us, and sometimes from the opposing
bank of the river.

"What the (sheol)'s that?" queried Dixon at length.
"Gittin' sort o' *satis* (adj.) *superque*."

"Cattle-pup," replied Thompson. "Millbank's people
gave him to me today. Stumpy-tailed breed. Poor little
chap's lonely; I'll fetch him down here." He went up the
bank and shortly returned, resuming his seat with the pup
on his knees. "Makings of a good dog, if I could only keep
him," he remarked sadly. "But I can't keep anything now.
I've had five dogs since that infernal thing came on me;<pb n="105"/>
and they're all gone. Wonder how long I'll be allowed to
keep this little cove?"

"Always easy to lose a good dog," remarked Binney.

"Any owner of a kangaroo dog will endorse that," I
sighed.

"The fidelity of some dogs is marvellous," observed the
trapper.

"See how a dog'll shepherd a drunk man," added Dixon.
"Wonder if the (animals) has souls?"

"The Jewish abhorrence of dogs seems rather strange to
us," remarked Lushington.

And so for five or ten minutes we discussed dogs in a
manner too trivial to be worth reproduction here.

{:.poetry}


"Now, boys," said the Colonel pleasantly, as he came down
the bank and resumed his rod and line, "what is the result
of your discussion? What moral or morals have you
derived from the first chapter of my story?"

"Well," replied Dixon frankly, "the thing's only *sub*
(adj.) *judice* yet in a manner o' speakin'; but we was jist
wonderin' among ourselves how sich a perseverin' 
strong-stummicked bloke as Fritz got down to what we see.
Should a' bin in the Upper House by this time, you'd
think."

"Time and chance happeneth unto them all, Dixon. Now,
Steve."

"I say he proved himself an all-round varmin if you
ask me anything about it," replied Thompson, sullenly
acquiescent in the Judge's expanding ascendancy. "Bad
blood, I suppose."

"Transparently right in the predicate and conventionally
wrong in the inference," commented the Major. "Next."

"The man is below criticism," remarked Binney, 
somewhat coldly.

"Manhood conceded, Mr Binney, the subject cannot be
below criticism, nor above. Every man has his place and
his use in the world. Nothing walks with aimless feet.
Fritz's vocation is to point a deduction or adorn a narrative.
A suppositious case would have been open to the 
imputation of falsity. Fact is authoritative. Next."

"The land transaction seems to be a very ordinary and<pb n="107"/>
vulgar piece of roguery," observed Lushington. "But I
cannot even apprehend the sentiment which must have
actuated the lovers in their strange decision."

"I endeavoured to make it understood that in their case
sentiment was subordinated to principle," replied the
Deacon, forbearingly.

"The story seems to me more unpleasant than 
instructive, Mr Rigby," remarked Furlong. "What can we learn
from the disgraceful fact that two lovers, with all the
possibilities of life before them, deliberately sold their
birthright?"

"We can learn one great lesson," replied the General,
"to wit, that the person who loves a fellow mortal more
than the bawbee is not worthy of the bawbee."

"But, after all," said I, "we've been most exercised over
the fact, so happily set forth in your yarn, that an almost
inevitable corollary of poverty is the violent itching to get
rid of it at any price. The demand of the footsore beggar
is identical with that of Richard at Bosworth; but supply
him with a horse, and, according to the wisdom of our
forefathers, he rides to the Evil One. From a moral point
of view it's a hopeless tangle. Fritz, in spite of his strictly
legal efforts, doesn't seem to have attained any permanent
exaltation, mentally, morally, or socially. Alcoholically
and temporarily, no doubt, he has often been so elevated
that his feet scorned the earth."

"Human nature at large is the beggar you speak of," 
replied the Deacon gravely. "We're all beggars and --"

"Not this (adj.) infant," muttered Dixon resentfully.

"-- and the difference between the mounted beggar -- 
hereditary or otherwise -- and the pedestrian beggar is merely
the difference between the devil's recruit actual and the
devil's recruit potential. The tangle is before us, right
enough, Tom. It's a moral tangle certainly, but a material
tangle in the first place, to be sorted out by material
agency; and seeing that we know of no avoirdupois 
intelligences in the universe except ourselves, will you tell
me who is to perform the sorting? For performed it must<pb n="108"/>
be, and the sooner the better. Disorder from its very nature
cannot be eternal. Now, approach this moral tangle 
inductively -- *a posteriori*, as Dixon would say -- and you'll find it
based on the temporal considerations which must underlie
every ethical problem in a world where daily necessities
and anxious forecast make us men primarily, and only
secondarily rogues or loafers. Here, at the very outset,
you're confronted by the immovable fact that superfluous
wealth in one class is always synchronised by 
corresponding poverty in another class. That fact, as a fact, is of
neutral morality. But to bring the material and moral 
questions into relation you will now inquire whether this 
disparity is for the best or for the worst. And to arrive at a
true answer, you must imagine yourselves as gracing the
very lowest walks of life, bearing in mind that the thing
hostile to your own higher interests is equally hostile to
the higher interests of your fellow-weed. You have
answered. Then, if there's any force in deductive -- or, for
Dixon's better understanding, *a priori* -- reasoning, we may
be sure that while the individual is encouraged to hold
rights as against society; while, to the economic perdition
of the many, the few are allowed to amass; while private
wealth carries the honor attached to the divine right of
aggression, misguided pedestrian beggars in great 
abundance will be found to offer their kingdom for a horse,
generally losing their kingdom and getting no horse after
all. Aggression is the divine right of the mounted beggar,
but, mark you, aggression is strictly limited by the point
of recoil on the opposing side, and by nothing else on
earth. And the line of human progress -- carrying within
itself this redeeming point of recoil, is advancing toward
the frontier of absolute right. That boundary, by the way,
will never be reached. Mundane administration cannot 
attain perfection. The line of perfection and the line of
human progress may be taken as representing a moral
asymptote."

A non-committal grunt of acquiescence masked the 
dignified mystification of our synod. We had forgotten Fritz<pb n="109"/>
by this time, and the Colonel, like Satan, was leading us
captive at his will.

"That is about as near as we can come to it," he 
continued after a reflective pause. "But in case that any of
you should not fully apprehend the illustration, I may
remind you that the asymptote is a mathematical paradox,
consisting of two converging lines which never intersect
each other. Let absolute perfection be represented by a
straight line of unlimited length, and human progress by
an approaching curve, with its convexity towards the
straight line. Extend this curve indefinitely, at the same
time expanding its arc to approximate, but never to reach,
your right line; and you may continue it for ever, always
approaching, though never blending. This, I think, is as
closely as we shall be able to work out the fulfilment of
our hackneyed petition, 'Thy will be done on earth as it
is done in heaven.' Take the avowal as a concession to your
individualism. The new order can well afford it."

"You must have a moral revolution first," observed
Binney.

"And isn't this moral revolution in progress now?" 
rejoined Rigby. "The vile snobbery of that axiom relating to
the beggar on horseback unmistakably stamps it as the
coinage of a former generation -- a generation that might
as well be hanged for stealing a sheep as a lamb. Our
pedestrian forefathers, my dear boys, were hanged 
wholesale for stealing lambs, and the very thought of accusing
their equestrian hangmen of riding to the devil was their
notion of the unpardonable sin, *vide* the current literature
of that day. Haven't we reformed this indifferently? And,
for the first time in history, isn't there a widespread 
movement toward reforming it altogether? The moral 
revolution that is imperceptible to you will appear to future ages
as a gigantic leap."

"But if things are working out their own cure, there's
no need for us to make trouble," objected Thompson.
"And this doesn't agree with your own preaching about<pb n="110"/>
the danger of some new style of slavery that'll bring us a
trifle below the level of dogs."

"Has the tendency of abuses been to work their own
cure, Steve?" asked the Senator, with a mildness almost
pompous. "Isn't history full of relapses? How often has
the ripe fruit of threescore years been blasted in a day?
Wasn't the Promised Land in sight eighteen centuries ago,
and weren't our forefathers, from age to age, forbidden
to enter in, because of their dense unbelief, and their lack
of moral enterprise, and their incurable hankering after the
congenial debasement of their fathers? Isn't the Promised
Land *always* within one day's march -- if the pilgrims are
worthy to occupy it? We are nearer to the border now
than ever before, but we may yet be sent back in the
wilderness to die off out of the way."

"Wilderness of Sin," interjected Dixon. "Stick to that
(adj.) argyment, Rigby. Can't better it."

"Your aptitude encourages me, Dixon. But, Steve, will
you assert that we now stand at either the base or the
summit of that toilsome ascent which leads upward from
palaeolithic savagery to the sixty-fifth chapter of Isaiah,
or the Fourth Eclogue of Virgil? You will not. Then, since
there is no safety-ratchet on the wheel of Progress, the
mere arduousness of our upward road implies a 
corresponding facility in the descent to a state worse than the first.
Now, what prevents relapse? Do you know that, wherever
old abuses are giving way, and new abuses are disallowed,
and citizen rights are being conceded -- there the pick of
humanity are battling for every inch of ground won from
their unduly-privileged fellow-men? Do you know that it
is the nature of oppression to intensify wherever resistance
slackens? Do you know that all popular progress is 
conditional on the untiring exertions of men who must 
practise the self-sacrifice they preach, and whose only hope
and aspiration is to pass on the torch to the next 
generation?" The Major paused a moment, then resumed --

"What cause do you suppose has operated to keep up<pb n="111"/>
the sun's light and heat since life first appeared on this
earth, Steve?" he asked.

"Well, so long as we get the light and heat," replied
Thompson, guardedly, "we needn't concern ourselves about
how they're manufactured. Likely they produce 
themselves, some way."

"Exactly," rejoined the Colonel. "However, the most
approved theory is, that the sun's power is maintained
unabated by the concussion of meteorites, which are 
swallowed up and absorbed by the solar mass. You would
imagine these meteorites lost, yet they serve the purpose
of making life possible on the planets. So the Spirit of
Freedom demands absolute self-surrender of certain 
individuals, as the price of light and warmth to others. And
where history shows periods of that national declension,
that all-round fitness for wiping-out, which inevitably 
follows on class-degradation, it merely signifies that the
meteorites of those periods are rare and sporadic, or have
ceased altogether; whilst a recorded influx of moral light
and an awakening glow of hope indicate a shower of these
erratic bodies, reinforcing the central source of vitality.
Ay, and as times go, the personal renunciation here implied
is better worth assay than anything else can be. This
magnificent virgin continent is amply worth it -- and the
time is opportune. The service is more than expedient; it is
imperative. For just fancy a community composed entirely
of well-meaning and self-centred men like you, and of
equally  well-meaning  and  self-centred  men  like  the
squatters you work for. What would be the inevitable 
outcome -- in view of the social-economic handicap now 
current? Why, your grandson, ear-marked and branded on the
off ribs with his owner's initials, would work out his 
damnation with fear and trembling, arrayed in a skimped form
of the Hindoo breech-clout; while your granddaughter,
cent per cent, more despicable still, would think herself
honoured if the local demigod condescended to exercise
his *droit de seigneur*."

"What's that?" asked Thompson, inadvertently.<pb n="112"/>

"Literally, 'landlord's right'. *Jus primae noctis* is the
legal term. It is the peasant bride's tribute to the landed
gentleman who virtually holds the power of life and death
over herself and her bridegroom. Read Beaumont and
Fletcher's *Custom of the Country*. Oh, your ancestresses,
for many succeeding generations, knew all about it. So
did mine, of course. See how pleasantly the Tory, Scott,
refers to the usage in his *Ravenswood*. Well, the 
prerogative is not dead, but dormant, pending a future broadening
down of vested rights. What is to prevent its revival, under
favourable conditions? Orthodoxy? Rot! Did orthodoxy
prevent it before? Did the orthodoxy of any governing
class ever stand in the way of the interests or appetites of
that class? Does orthodoxy stand in the way of capitalism,
of usury, of profit-mongering, of land monopoly, or any
other monopoly, of royalism, or of anything that panders
to class-domination? Where is the limit to human 
aggression upon humanity, unless that aggression be sternly
checked -- and what appeal to oligarchy has ever proved
operative, except an appeal to its fears? Well, Steve, in the
natural sequence of events, the institution I have modestly
hinted at will be restored -- not by statute law, of course,
but by social-economic pressure -- in the time of your
granddaughters, if you have any."

"No, I'm d--d if it will," muttered Thompson.

"There you are," replied the Judge, complacently. "That
is precisely what my ancestor, the free barbarian Gurth,
said thirteen hundred years ago. See how history repeats
itself." The Senator paused and lit his pipe.

"Better if we had died when we were kids," remarked
Thompson bitterly. "Better be dead than making trouble.
But I don't give a hand," he continued, finding relief as
the abstract moral question dissociated itself and drifted
out beyond his own personal horizon. "Most of the 
squatters are fine, straight men -- a lot better than we are, if it
comes to that."

"Be it so," replied the Deacon, with ominous pliancy.
"David may be a good king, as kings go; but his successor,
Solomon, makes the burdens grievous, and chastises the
bearers with whips; his successor, Rehoboam, whilst
frankly acknowledging the hardship, avows his intention
of making the burdens more grievous, and chastising the
bearers with scorpions; and so the thing broadens down
smoothly and spontaneously. Time will sanctify any 
encroachment and petrify any grip; hence the tendency of
classes is to congeal into castes. Freedom comes back in
strong convulsions, often accompanied by haemorrhage,
never without strenuous battle in field or senate, waged
under terrible disadvantage. Nothing is easier than for
Pompey to laugh away his birthright; nothing is harder
than for him to weep it back again."

"God looks after all these contracts that's too (adj.)
heavy for us chaps," observed Dixon, piously.

"A popular mistake, Dixon, and to some extent, a 
pardonable one, but a mistake nevertheless. At what point does<pb n="114"/>
God interpose? Think over that. God cannot interpose
in this matter, except by miracle; and the age of miracles
is past. The Lord of those servants is gone into a far
country, leaving them in charge of his vineyard, with a
guarantee that, while the earth remaineth, summer and
winter, and seed-time and harvest, and day and night, shall
not cease. The rest is ours. A fine allegory -- reiterated,
evidently, for emphasis, in the guise of Pounds or Talents
entrusted for augmentation. Bear in mind that we are
responsible caretakers of the vineyard, not freeholders, or
even lessees. So also with the Many. Here the Eternal is
a Usurer, and an Austere Man. Now, there you have the
grandest hypothesis ever presented to mankind. We need
look no further for a Scheme of the Universe. Observe
that there is one demand upon us, and only one --to wit,
consistent effort toward progressive betterment of this
planet, for the -- for the -- what shall I say in lieu of that
parrot-phrase, 'Glory of God?' But how is that for an
Increasing Purpose? Can you improve upon it? And now
tell me, boys, in what conceivable way you think you can
glorify God, except by working toward the elevation of
the human race, as a whole? -- a movement which carries
with it all subordinate interests of the earth. To be sure,
God has been very considerably glorified since man 
differentiated himself from the apes. But we are only on the
threshold of progress yet, and it is manifestly incumbent
upon each one of us, freeman or slave --"

"Now, Mr Rigby," protested the clergyman, rousing
himself from the sorcerous spell of the Senator's rhetoric,
"pray remember that you are speaking to Englishmen. The
distinction of master and servant we cheerfully recognise;
but slavery is a different matter."

"True," replied the Sheriff, gently. "And the grade of
the 'servant' is, in reality, much lower than that of the
'slave'. At a time when slavery was not the exclusive badge
of inferior races, but stood fairly on its merits, the slave
looked down on the wages man, and was entitled to do
so. You will find this statement supported by all the<pb n="115"/>
evidence available. 'Hireling', or 'hired servant', in our
translations of sacred and classical literature, is always a
term of reproach; whilst 'servant' -- which, in every instance,
means either bondman or vassal -- carries the idea of 
servitude without ignominy. You may remember that passage
in the *Oedipus Tyrannus* of Sophocles, wherein a slave
plumes himself upon belonging to his master: 'Born in his
house; no hireling I,' he says. And you're all familiar with
the parable of the Prodigal Son --"

"Feedin' pigs?" interposed Dixon, in genial assent. "Yes,
(sheol) of a comedown for that bloke; an' served him
(adv.) well right. Heard a sermon on it, a couple o' year
ago; an' the parson he fetched it out red-hot."

"No doubt," replied the Judge wearily. "But did he invite
your attention to the fact that, just as the whole resources
of Oriental hyperbole are exhausted in the degradation
of the prodigal to a swineherd -- lower than which, in
Jewish estimation, no man could possibly sink -- so his
humiliation touches the conceivable nadir of abject 
submission: 'Make me, I pray thee, as one of thy hired 
servants.' The author of the parable could cite no depth of
penal servility beyond *that*. We speak of the labor market,
and rightly too; well, the vast majority of our 
fellow-citizens are chattels in that market. Playing it pretty low
down on the reputed image of God -- isn't it? But whether
the scheme of human life includes personal service to a
personal master or not is immaterial. The Man Friday may
be a permanent institution. The amended Antony of the
future may have his unpurchaseable Eros; the ameliorated
Timon, his Flavius; the improved Uncle Toby, his Corporal
Trim. And if an immeasurably higher grade of civilisation
should still produce anti-types of the men who fought and
died for Charlie, these will certainly find somewhat
worthier objects of personal devotion. But there will be an
end to that ghastly dislocation of order which occurs when
the personal service is one of ignominious necessity, not of
self-respecting fidelity. However, to return to my story -- 
with apologies for this digression --<pb n="116"/>

"It is worth while to bear in mind that man was, and is,
made upright, but he has sought out many inventions. And,
to avoid all ground of offence, let it be understood that,
in speaking of the man who is made upright, I refer
neither to the gardener of Eden nor to the pithecoid
gentleman of Science; but simply to the everyday infant,
mewling and puking in the perambulator. Unfortunately,
this peculiarly human faculty of invention, or initiative, is
turned by its possessor to an account which always 
obscures, and generally extinguishes, the manifest purpose of
his existence. Like Falstaff's boy, he hath a good angel in
him, but the devil outbids him. In a civilised state, he must
have an aim of some sort; and his first mistake is to accept
St Paul's halting metaphor of the life-race, with a prize
for the winner, and devil take the hindmost. His next 
mistake is to set up one of his pet inventions as a prize, and to
qualify for the race by pawning the god-like element in
his nature. Remember that, whether he wins or loses the
prize, he inevitably forfeits the stake. Now I want you to
notice how faithfully Fritz and Mina pressed on toward
the mark of their high calling, namely, that invention
known as the 'medium of exchange'."

The Colonel resumed: "Mina's last letter was five or six
months old when Fritz reached Berlin; and that period
had been an eventful one. A Jewish lawyer had found an
informality in Isaacstein's will, which rendered the 
instrument invalid, and thus brought into force a former will,
made in a sulky fit, a year previously. By the provisions of
this disruptive document, three-fourths of the old 
gentleman's assets passed to a distant relation, and Mina was
placed under a complication of liabilities and obligations
deliberately calculated to eat up her legacy. The poor,
outwitted woman had desperately disputed this will in court,
with the result that a week or two before Fritz arrived
to claim her as his bride, she had returned, destitute and
friendless, to her sixteen hours' shift in the carpet factory.

"Mina's misfortune was a terrible blow to Fritz, 
especially as he couldn't regard it in the light of an impediment
to their marriage. An impediment is an entity, an actuality,
a thing to be grappled with, or outflanked, or outlived.
Herr Moses, for instance, was an impediment. But here was
an evanishment, invulnerable to any weapon or any 
tactics. Just imagine a man trying to overcome, or circumvent,
or weary-out, a vacuum! The great gulf fixed between
the well-to-do and the poverty-stricken is quite as 
impracticable on this side of the grave as on the other; and Fritz
<pb n="118"/>
felt as one standing on the edge of that plummetless abyss,
looking across the yawning depths into Mina's pleading,
haunting eyes. This, of course, is figurative, for the lovers
literally mingled their tears as they sat together in her
poor apartment. But murmured vows, and clinging kisses,
and the mutual retrospect of youthful aspirations could
never bring back those fifteen thousand thalers -- the absence
of which merely made the heart grow fonder. That long
heart-sickness of hope deferred by the tenacity of Herr
Moses was now to become a chronic ailment. Fritz clothed
himself in sackcloth and went softly; he metaphorically
attired himself in this fabric because his hopes were dead;
he literally went softly because the Fatherland -- then
furtively preparing for war with France -- was likely to give
him a cheap uniform and a soldier's grave. In the end, he
tearfully embraced the doubly-widowed Mina, and tore
himself away, after giving her, as a farewell present, the
sum of one thousand pfennigs --'

"He ain't my idear of a (adj.) man," observed Dixon;
"same time, I give him credit for whackin' the (adj.) spons
after that style."

"-- equal in value to exactly eight-and-four pence of our
money --"

"(Sheol)," breathed Dixon, in moral collapse.

" -- and so they parted for ever. Orpheus and Eurydice
over again. A cruel mockery of restoration, serving only
to add poignancy to the final severance. Mina returned to
her carpet factory, to revel in the luxury of despair -- the
only luxury she could afford -- while Fritz slipped quietly
away, and took his passage to Melbourne. His love for
Mina was intensified to distraction by a forecast of her
desolation in the coming years, when he would be pursuing
his own career, feet uppermost in a foreign land; but there
was balm for himself in that antipodal Gilead, if he could
only be on the spot in time to secure it. Everybody on
board noticed his impatience during the voyage; and, on
reaching port, he was the first passenger to skip ashore and
hurry to the railway station."

"Within sight of Fritz's selection, on Tartpeena," 
continued the Major, "there had stood a roadside pub, doing
a rattling business under the management of a licensee,
whom I remember merely as a full-shaved man, with ten
days' growth of iron-grey stubble *always* on his face.
Diligent in business -- as per Apostolic precept -- this Mr
Maginnis had in course of time surrounded so many 
hogsheads of tanglefoot that his career of usefulness seemed
rapidly drawing to a close. Mrs Maginnis was an abstainer,
a fine, dashing woman, blithe and frolicsome, and about a
hundred years younger in wisdom than her good man. She
had fairly pestered the reticent, melancholy selector with
her courtesies and confidences. Her autobiographical 
narrative was simple. Dazzled in her girlhood by Maginnis's
wealth, she had married him, only to find that she didn't
love him. Her ideal was a fair man, of quiet demeanour;
and her heart told her she could love no other. She knew
that Maginnis wouldn't long be spared to her; and she
would remain a widow for the rest of her life. She would
still have little Jimmy left, and Maginnis's will secured her
a lot of property in her own right."

The Major paused. I was glad to notice a tinge of 
compunction showing through the habitual cynicism of his
tone and words. He mastered this weakness, however, and
continued:

"Such had been the burden of the young matron's song<pb n="120"/>
only half a year before, so there was good reason for
Fritz's impatience. It even occurred to him that Maginnis's
clothes would be about his size. He crossed the couple of
hundred miles of country between Melbourne and 
Tartpeena in record time, and presented himself at the door of
the Traveller's Rest, with a fluttering heart, for the sign
intimated that a person named Algernon Sidney was now
authorised to dispense the hospitalities of the bar. Here
Fritz learned that a couple of months after his own 
departure for Europe, Maginnis had gone to join his 
brother-blockader, Isaacstein, in the Elysian fields. Mrs Maginnis,
sole legatee of her husband's extensive Melbourne property
-- had gone to the metropolis, to watch her interests. The
Traveller's Rest was already let, on lease, by the executors,
on behalf of Jimmy, to whom it had been bequeathed by
his father.

"Back to Melbourne fled Fritz, sickened with 
apprehension, maddened by the coquetry of Fortune, and
invoking the milk and water curses of his complicated
language on his own want of prevision. But zeal and
persistence seldom fail in the end -- a fact which each of us
would do well to bear in mind -- and, on reaching 
Melbourne, Fritz obtained from the late Mr Maginnis's
solicitors the address of his new cynosure."

"What the (adj. sheol's) that?" demanded Dixon 
inadvertently.

"Literally, 'dog's tail'."

"Hum, had (adv.) simple. Well, I give you credit."

"No, no Dixon; you mustn't take me in that way. It's
the Greek name of a star in 'Ursa Minor', or the Little Bear
 -- a northern constellation, invisible to us here. Rather an
anomaly in astronomical nomenclature, that the dog's tail
should be an appendage of the Little Bear. However, it's
the poetical name of the Polar star."

"Political name o' the poler Star," mused Dixon. "No
(adj.) savvy."

"Not your height," said Thompson, ill-naturedly. "But
Rigby's always correct in his dic., no matter how rotten<pb n="121"/>
his arguments are. He has Milton to back him for using
'cynosure' in that sense. Let's see -- it's in *Comus*, I think,
yes:

- {:.indent-3}And thou shalt be our star of Arcady,
- {:.indent-3}Or Tyrian Cynosure."
{:.poetry}

"What's your opinion of *that*" I asked Lushington, aside.
(As a matter of fact, the twelve Standard Works comprised
about one-half of Thompson's aggregate reading, hence
every book had left its impression on his mind, like a
replica in copying ink. Indeed he afterward told me that he
had committed to memory this particular passage, thinking
it might come in handy for courting purposes.)

"It takes my breath away," murmured Lushington.
"I've been strangely misinformed respecting the erudition
of bullock drivers. Latin and Milton. Are they all like this?"

"Certainly not. Other branches of knowledge are no less
ably represented. They excel chiefly as linguists. But there
goes the Colonel again."

"Fritz presented himself to Mrs Maginnis at the hotel
where she was temporarily residing. He called upon her
again and again, daily escorting her to some place of popular
resort. If he was delighted to find her unchanged, she was
no less gratified to learn that her image, engraven on
his heart, had impelled him to repulse a young German
heiress, and perforce return to his Australian enchantress,
like the weary dove to its gin case. This was by far the
happiest era of his life. Let me explain that I hold 
Shakespeare's audacious insistence upon Romeo's fascination for
Rosaline, up to the very moment of his meeting with Juliet,
to be one of the most masterly strokes within the range
of plays. A man's first love never scores. Metaphorically,
the first love is a mere encounter with the cushion, which,
however, produces a recoil; and it is this recoil that scores.
We have already wept with Fritz over his rebound from
Mina's unprofitable side, where, in the nature of things,
it was impossible to pocket; we shall presently see how the
tangential impulse coincident upon this resilient 
projection --"<pb n="122"/>

"Not this (adj.) time, ole feller," muttered Dixon.

"-- enabled him to register the highest score allowed by
the laws of the game. Moreover, if the saying be true, that
love goes by contraries, what could be more natural than
that the quiet, offensively blonde German and the 
mettlesome, black-eyed Irish-Australian should reciprocate? Still,
no bliss is without alloy. There were times when the ghost
of a dead past rose unbidden, throwing its chill shadow
across the sunny present, and into the fairyland 
future -- times when Mina's desolation recurred to Fritz, and his
heart was wrung with anguish as he mentally totted up the
expenses of his fruitless voyage. But Louisa would box his
ears and tickle his ribs when her quick eye detected the fit
coming on. 'Money gone, you goose,' she would say. 'Ain't
I better than money?' You will observe that Fritz was
scoring.

"Not only was she better than money, but she had the
latter in abundance. Her property consisted of about a
dozen cottages, two shops, and a hotel; and her rent-roll -- 
as she casually remarked to her lover -- varied from £15 to
£20 per week. He, after verifying the information by
private interviews with some of the tenants in the 
bar-parlor of the hotel, spent his own money with a somewhat
freer hand, and about six weeks after his arrival, the 
solemnisation took place. I gave the bride away."

Again the Deacon paused and sighed. Then the ice of
carefully-cultivated cynicism closed over the inadvertent
thaw, and he continued:

"I happened to be working on a Melbourne daily at the
time, and having met Fritz a fortnight before the happy
day, we renewed our old intimacy, when he forced upon
me, in a rather boastful way, the details I have recalled
for your instruction. Only up to the date of the ceremony,
of course. The sequel to his marriage he told me about a
year afterward, sobbing on my neck, and smelling like a
brewery in a good way of business. At that time he was
keeping a shanty on Spring Creek, and I was working out
an excellent little industry in connection with a carpenter<pb n="123"/>
in Sandhurst and two carriers on the track. We used to
buy empty weatherboard houses at Sandhurst, and sell them,
re-erected, on Spring Creek. Then, of course, you 
remember how the second flood of '70 swamped every claim
on Spring Creek beyond remedy; and the last great 
alluvial diggings of Victoria was snuffed out. 
Nineteen-twentieths of the people left Spring Creek immediately,
and among the exiles were Fritz and myself." The General
paused, as if losing himself in retrospect.

"That was thirteen years ago," he continued, 
meditatively, "and I never met him again till this afternoon.
Jimmy Maginnis tells me his mother died two years back.
Poor vivacious mercurial woman. To this favor she has
come. Merely the common lot. She would have died 
hereafter. There would have been a time for such a word.
Probably she was content. While the future extends in
front, death seems a calamity; when the past extends 
behind, the same event becomes an acquaintance. Thackeray,
revelling in that purposeless cynicism which is his leading
characteristic, has a remark to the effect that 'if you would
die regretted, you must die young'. Ah, boys, it is a 
cheerless element of truth that gives point to this ruthless
apophthegm, for we instinctively know, though the 
impression is not formulated, nor even apprehended, that a 
life-work in the elevation of humanity is open to the young,
while this task has already been fulfilled, or evaded, or
repudiated by the old. Still, the bare truth is cruel. Indeed,
it is difficult to conceive how any man can be a cynic,
seeing that he himself is as frail, fallible, and ephemeral, as
the subject of his misplaced derision."<pb n="124"/>

"But hold on," said Thompson, circumspectly, "you led
us to think that Mrs Maginnis had houses to the value of
fifteen or twenty notes a week?"

"Such was my frank intention, Stephen."

"And this didn't continue?"

"Nothing continues, my boy. But this terminated with
dismal abruptness. Immediately after their marriage, Mrs
Wetterliebenschaff mentioned to her husband, in a tacitly
apologetic way, that a slight error had crept into her 
statement of assets -- though rather an omission than a 
misstatement. Here we must glance back a few years. The
late Mr Maginnis, rightly calculating the effect of the Land
Act, had mortgaged his city property to build and furnish
the Traveller's Rest. Then, desiring to remove the 
encumbrance as quickly as possible, and remembering how he
had originally enfeoffed himself of the Melbourne 
property by unloading Koh-i-noors and Golden Fleeces on
the very crest of the great mining boom in '64, he turned
his attention to El Dorados, Pactoluses, Great Golcondas,
and other certainties, intending to repeat the operation. But
the other fellows had gone out in the tide this time, and
there was a stony glitter in the eyes of the public. 
Meanwhile, so spirited and enterprising were the directorates<pb n="125"/>
of these Dead Sea apples that his own city rents, along with
the surplus profits of the Traveller's Rest, became, in the
literal, though by no means in the accepted sense, a 
sinking fund. At last the time came when Maginnis stepped
over to consult Isaacstein on the retention of the 
unretainable -- the only question that had occupied either of the
worthy men here, and, by every rule of growth and 
continuity, the only question that can interest them whilst
individuality holds good. But compound interest had
undermined the city property before Mrs Maginnis came
into possession, and, of course, she was fooled to the top
of her bent by the strictly practical jokers of the Civil law.
Excellent client as she was, she never could make out how
it happened; but, by the time of her second marriage, 
somebody was impounding her rents as the agent collected them,
whilst offering the property for sale by private contract,
with a reserve price which merely represented the aggregate
encumbrance, inclusive of liberal pickings for the learned
gentlemen who were so dexterously piloting the lady
through her little proceedings. By the way, the Hebrew
word for usury -- *neshek* -- signifies 'to devour'. The poor
woman, on mentioning this matter to her husband, went
on to asseverate that the loss of property didn't cost her a
second thought, as she still had Fritz, and indeed she had
him to perfection.

"It was about thirty-six hours before he came to, and
even then he went on like one that hath been hocussed. He
fancied himself standing on the deck of a 'Frisco steamer,
with a small portmanteau in his hand, whilst a peculiar
sensation of coldness on his upper lip seemed to convey
the reminder that his moustache was amongst the sweepings
of a barber's shop. The consciousness of a foreign accent
also appeared to weigh upon what was left of his mind,
and he heard himself remarking to the bystanders in a
hollow voice that he was a Norwegian gentleman travelling
for pleasure and that his name was Bjornson -- Mr Henrik
Bjornson, of Sondre Trondhjems. Then, in pitiless response
to this ingenuous admission, one of his auditors seemed to<pb n="126"/>
draw him aside and show him a blue document, at the sight
of which his heart became as water. Everybody appeared
to take an interest in him as he accompanied his new
friend ashore, whilst a marine officer's flippant remark -- 
'White-headed boy ain't goin' eastward from Eden this
trip, I reckon' -- sounded like the rippling of water on a
drowned rat. Then he saw in his dream, and behold his
plain-clothes conductor signalled a cab, whereupon £'s
of forfeited passage money surged on his apprehension like
the lost legions of Varus on the memory of Augustus.
There is no burlesque in the simile, let me tell you, boys,
for the question is one of estimation, not of mere magnitude.
As with Claudio, the poor fellow had offended, but as in a
dream; nevertheless, they were going to make it out a
case of attempted wife-desertion within the meaning of the
Act. But all this was merely a preparatory exercise, as the
machinery of the phantasmagoria fell into working order
with a view to grinding out a series of transformation
scenes, each more gruesome than its forerunner, and the
least intolerable along them throwing his present ignominy
into an aspect of idyllic felicity. Edgar is right -- 'The worst
is never come while we can say, "This is the worst."'
Most of us have noticed, or will yet have occasion to
notice that, when Nemesis gets her second wind."

"Don't, Jeff," protested Thompson sullenly. "I'm 
anything but a superstitious man myself; still I feel it's not safe
to make a joke of affliction, though it may be a person's
own doing."

"Your sense of humor must be a subtle one, Steve, if you
detect any joke in a tragedy like this," replied the Major
with sincerity. "However, Fritz hadn't finished scoring
yet. Too much broken up to think of soliciting bail, he
passed a night as the guest of Her Britannic Majesty. Next
morning, while he was endeavouring to give some account
of himself to the Bench, various members of the Devil's
Brigade put in clients' claims, amounting in the aggregate
to something like £600 -- all of which Fritz paid, in the state
of merciful coma which still enveloped his faculties. Then<pb n="127"/>
his forgiving wife -- cheerfully forgoing the sureties to which
she was legally entitled -- led him away to listen to 
explanations which she felt certain would set his mind at rest.
It appeared that in addition to the difficulty of the mortgage
she had been, perhaps, a little extravagant -- a not unusual
feature, I notice, in the character of the Irish-Australian.
Business men, who knew her as a customer, believed her to
be well off and forced credit on her -- she being nothing
loth. By the time these people had begun to feel uneasy,
Fritz was proudly appearing everywhere with her as her
accepted suitor; and a word in private between the business
man aforesaid and the manager of the bank which honored
Fritz's cheques, had paved the way to further credit for
the lady. Fritz's personal liability for her prior debts would,
of course, date from the completion of his polysyllabic
signature to the marriage register. You will perceive that
he was still scoring.

"To conclude, Fritz, whose capital was now reduced by
nearly one-half, took a five years' lease of the hotel which
he had fondly regarded as his own in life interest, and
resolutely settled down to redeem his mis-spent moments
past. According to the custom in such cases, he 
interviewed the outgoing tenant as to the quantity of beer
sold; and this gentleman's information he privately verified
by a conference with the brewer who supplied the house.
The result of his investigations indicated a fine turnover,
and on this the rental and goodwill was based. It may be
worth your while to know that the doctrine of averages -- 
so insisted on by Buckle -- maintains a reliable ratio 
between the demand for beer and for other wets, so that
from one factor you may work out the total.

"But Fritz afterwards found that the new owner of his
wife's former property -- a wealthy and influential M.L.C. -- 
had made it worth the out-going tenant's while, and had
also given a hint to the brewer. In addition to this, it was
largely a jug business. In addition to this again, Fritz's
inexperience soon betrayed him into the indiscretion of
reporting a roguish member of the force, whose manner<pb n="128"/>
toward the landlady seemed to indicate that policemen are
but mortal. After this blunder, the Mistletoe Bough 
became the best-watched house in Melbourne. The 
stipendiary happened to be a man who shared Dixon's healthy
hostility to people with a foreign accent; and though Fritz
did the smallest Sunday business in town, the police and
the Bench managed to keep up a good reputation on him.
He stood this for six or eight months; but the gradient
becoming steeper and steeper, and the Englishmen's hell in
full blast coming more and more clearly into view, he put
down the brake, and went through for three half-crowns
in the pound. To return to our old metaphor, he was still
scoring. He opened the business at Spring Creek, with a
capital reduced to about £200. On leaving Spring Creek,
he went through again -- this time for one-and-six -- and
opened somewhere in the Wimmera, with a capital still
further diminished. He was in that quarter till Jimmy came
of age; then the family removed to the Traveller's Rest,
where Mrs Wetterliebenschaff died. Fritz, having by this
time finished his superb break, laid up his cue, and took the
back seat he has since occupied. I'm very glad to notice
that Jimmy is kind to the poor fellow. It is only his due,
for no man could have excelled him as a gentle, affectionate
husband, and a considerate stepfather. May he rest in
peace."

The Deacon paused, and lit his pipe, whilst an 
indescribable something in his manner seemed to denote that he still
held the floor, and intended to keep it. The cessation of the
story merely conveyed a tacit challenge of comment, and
this we all felt; but the silence was broken only by Dixon's
muttered rendition of the last pious sentence into Latin,
with an Australian intercalation by way of artless 
adornment.<pb n="129"/>

"Now, boys," continued the Senator, "I'm well aware that
the sediment of meaning left in your minds by my story
crystallises into an emotion of gratitude to heaven that
you are not as other men are, or even as this publican. This
is utterly and cruelly wrong. To judge Fritz justly, you
must imagine him still alive, and with a stake in the
country; a man whose obvious interest lies in strict 
respectability. His sole aim during life was to attain such a position
of repute; and, in common fairness, you must judge him
as you would wish to be judged; that is, by aspiration and
effort, rather than by attainment. Of all the vanquished men
I have known -- and Legion is an inadequate name for them
 -- not one has died harder than Fritz. He was congenitally
a man of indomitable purpose, though of flabby principle;
therefore, a mean and sordid environment made him a mean
and sordid skunk. A criminal environment would have
made him a thief, though never a highwayman. A generous
environment would have made him a Florence Nightingale,
though never an Old John Brown."

"And a religious environment, Mr Rigby?" ventured
Lushington, with a professional solicitude reminiscent of
the man who thought there was nothing like leather.

"The word 'religious' has unfortunately so many shades
of meaning that I scarcely know how to formulate an<pb n="130"/>
answer," replied the Colonel. "But I submit that our hero
was, in the first place, mentally limited, and morally
neutral, or nearly neutral; therefore, I should say, an
evangelical environment would have made him a son of
consolation, though never a son of thunder -- other mundane
conditions of tutelage being, of course, duly taken into
account, along with the altogether subordinate factor of
heredity; and, finally, an almost imperceptible margin
allowed for human cussedness. Speaking broadly, the poor
fellow's environment is responsible for his failure."

The Major paused a moment in guileful deference to his
questioner, then resumed.

"But individual misadventure, rightly used, contributes
to general safety. If we locate, identify, and characterise the
rocks on which Fritz unhappily bumped his hooker -- above
all, if we chart the ocean currents and magnetic variations
which conducted him to perdition -- we shall, in a sense,
raise him from the moral status of a stone-broke bummer
to that of a universal benefactor. In other words, seeing
that he has drawn fire and located the enemy, we ought to
honor his memory by acknowledging the service. To
my mind his exploit clamors for recognition. Like King
John, he does not ask you much; he begs cold comfort,
and you are so strait and so ungrateful you deny him that."

Here the Sheriff paused for a full minute, evidently
yearning for some assailant with a self-imbedded conviction
that the world's crime, brutality, sordidness, ignorance,
squalor and general degradation were directly or indirectly
attributable to liquor. But our congress happened to lack
this species of zealot, so all hands sat silent as effigies, and
for a space no man came forth to win the narrow way.

"We all admit that polite environment makes the 
gentleman and vulgar environment the vulgarian," he continued,
metaphorically trailing the tail of his coat slowly along
before the meeting, "and this is perfectly correct."

"With certain reservations," essayed Lushington, 
figuratively touching the coat with his toe.

"With certain reservations," repeated the Judge <pb n="131"/>
gratefully. "As, for instance, that the son of the gentleman
brought up from earliest infancy in a city slum may, by
virtue of his pedigree, unfold gentlemanly instincts, just
as an eagle's egg hatched by a goose may disclose an eagle."

"Something of that kind," replied Lushington.

"Good. What Dixon would call the *argumentum ad
hominem* seems justifiable here. Would you like to try that
experiment on your own son? Wouldn't you a thousand
times rather see him decently buried? And what entitles
your son, or my son, or any man's son, to higher privileges
than the son of the slum-denizen? I may mention that I
am searching these provinces for some educated and 
intelligent man audacious enough to assert, without phrases, that
the Eternal (I should prefer to use a name implying closer
relationship, but experience has taught me that the New
Testament conception of Deity is apt to irritate) -- some man
hardy enough, I say, to maintain that this first cause can
possibly sanction the prospective abasement of children
unable to distinguish between their right hand and their
left. Still keeping to the question of environment -- why do
we -- but -- I beg your pardon -- may I ask if you are 
connected with the business?"

"Which business?"

"The business. Licensed victualling."

"No, Mr Rigby," replied the clerygman, enjoying the
joke. "In spite of my unfortunate name I'm a 
life-abstainer."

"I'm practically an abstainer myself, though not a pledged
one," rejoined the Deacon, "and I'm happy to have so much
in fellowship with you. Excuse my question. It was
prompted by the recollection of what happened to me
the night before last at a hotel in Corowa. I had marked an
old gentleman of amiable demeanour, though of rather
ascetic appearance, who drank nothing but water. We got
into conversation and I spent three solid hours in 
endeavouring to point out to him that one effect of a perfect social
system would be to bring alcohol to its true place as a
valuable, though somewhat hazardous medicine. I <pb n="132"/>
afterwards ascertained that he was owner of a thriving distillery.
But, Mr Lushington, to what end do we impose restraint
on the sale of intoxicants? Why do you agitate for the still
closer restriction of Local Option, Prohibition or what
not, and why do I argue for State Monopoly? Is it not
because we wish to alter our environment for the better
by making the line of sobriety the line of least resistance?
Don't we, in this instance, admit that is allowing a very
little for heredity?"

"Come, Mr Rigby," interposed Lushington, overflowing
with academic counsel, "you must acknowledge with all
our foremost authorities, that dipsomania is a transmitted
weakness, or, at least, that heredity is a very powerful
factor here."

"A far-reaching one, certainly," conceded the General,
"seeing that Noah's unfortunate propensity, latent for -- 
let's see -- take Ussher's chronology -- latent for, say, one
hundred and thirty generations, reappears in the Australian
Aborigines, a race as susceptible to the temptation of
drink as any on earth. Remembering the Aborigines,
then, along with all other races of immemorial sobriety
and allowing as much as you please for heredity, don't we
admit that, so far as temperance is concerned, the 
environment is a matrix wherein the individual is moulded? And
does it not become us, for the sake of consistency, to extend
the rule indefinitely, first inquiring, of course, whether our
social-economic environment is conducive to production
of the highest personal excellence all round? If you reply
that it is so conducive, the argument is ended. If you
acknowledge that here, in an aspiring community, our
environment is bad, and we ourselves, from infancy 
upward, debased by slavery or corrupt by power, then you
tacitly concede the advisableness of a radical change in
the worldly conditions under which we live."

"Rings the bell every time he's let," whispered Sam to
me. "Why don't you fellers give him his head?"<pb n="133"/>

"Your protest is premature, Sonny," I replied in the same
tone. "Time and the Colonel against any two, or any two
dozen."

But though Rigby was now fairly started, he still failed
to connect, and this time the hindrance came from an
unexpected quarter.

"It seems to me that all secular remedies must fail to cure
even secular evils," observed Furlong with mild 
doggedness in his tone, rising from his seat as he spoke, and laying
his rod against the steep bank. "The fashion of this world
passeth away, and the time is coming to us all when to
him that hath -- that is, to him that hath chosen the good
part which shall not be taken away -- to him that hath shall
be given, and he shall have more abundantly; but from
him that hath not, shall be taken away even that which he
seemeth to have -- by which we understand, the treasure
laid up on earth. 'Seemeth to have' is a fine expression. I'm
afraid, Mr Rigby, the tendency of your moral is to limit,
or even to explain away, human responsibility."

I expected to hear a sigh of mental fatigue from the
Judge, and my forecast was fulfilled.

"Talkin' about morals," rejoined Dixon, as the trapper
climbed the bank, "it's a moral we ain't goin' to ketch no
(adj.) fish, no matter how we keep off o' swearin', an' I bin
ridin' myself with a martingale all the (adj.) evenin'. My
idears is mostly runnin' on that thirty-pound fish you
caught here, Thompson."

"Strange how the very same thing has been running in
my own mind," replied Thompson pensively. "How little
I thought then that I would be sitting here tonight, older
and sadder, and not much wiser, thinking of all the changes
that have taken place since then. How well I remember<pb n="135"/>
it. I had my feet on that root above Tom's head, for the
river was --"

"Specify your river, Steve," I interrupted airily, for it
seemed evident that either Thompson's reason or mine was
reeling on her throne.

"Oh, shut up. It was ten or twelve feet higher than it is
now. Malky Cameron was sitting just above where Mr
Binney is and Billy was away after frogs. Of course, Agnes
wasn't allowed to be out after nightfall. The thought just
occurred to me now that perhaps in future years some one
of us may sit here again, watching his float and thinking of
tonight."

"There is an element of poetry in the suggestion," I
remarked thoughtfully. "By the way, when was it you
caught that thirty-pounder, Steve?"

"Ten years ago, last May -- coming eleven years, now,"
replied Thompson dreamily. "About three weeks before
my unfortunate trip in the canoe."

For the next two minutes you could have cut the silence
into slices with a hay-knife.

"Where's Furlong?" asked the Colonel at length. "Did
he take his rod with him?"

"He's only gone to roast a fresh bit of possum for a
bait," I replied. "He missed the ghastly disclosure."

"No, he was listening all along," said the unconscious
Thompson. "But the vanity of things in general is no
ghastly disclosure to him, I fancy. He's had his share of
trouble; and he's made the right use of it. Not like me."

"You know him, Steve?" I inquired.

"No, I can't say that I do. I met him once, some years
ago. But he's a man I'd take to be as straight as a rule."

"He might have a romance in his life, too," I suggested.

"I wouldn't hint anything to him about it, Tom; he
seems very reserved."

"Both you an' him's the clean spud, anyhow, bullocky,"
interposed the sharp voice of the kangaroo hunter. "If
everybody was like me an' him an' you, the world would<pb n="136"/>
be fit for a man to live in, which it ain't, not by a long
chalk."

During the uncomfortable pause that ensued, the trapper
returned, baited his hook, threw his line into the river, and
resumed his seat. Then, unconsciously forestalling the
Major, he deferentially put in his word, discoursing with
the slow precision of a systematic thinker, whose verb
had been trained to agree with its nominative. He seemed
to speak almost by rote, like a man giving utterance to
thoughts perpetually present and attired in the same verbal
garb. (For we always think in words.) His tone bespoke
the turtle-dove severity of one reluctantly constrained to
draw on behalf of a principle in which his own i
ndividuality had become merged and lost. As a mere detail, his 
sermon was marred by that lamentable mismanagement of the
"h" and that disregard for the "r" which distinguishes
participants in the glorious charter, deny it who can.

"Whilst listening to your conversation, Mr Rigby," he
said, "the uppermost thought in my mind was the 
opportunity of usefulness which you allow to pass unheeded,
forgetful of the reward which might be yours. Why do
you not turn your fine abilities in the right direction? See
how closely Daniel xii, 3, might apply to you: 'And they
that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament;
and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for
ever and ever.' I feel very deeply on this subject, for I 
myself lived in bondage to Satan for twenty-nine years; and
though it has pleased God to call me out of darkness into
His marvellous light, I can never recall the wasted time."

"I never flog over them (adj.) idears," remarked Dixon,
uneasily. "I'll jist slip across an' shove the (adj.) fire
together," he continued. "May's well treat ourselves to a
drink o' tea when school's out."

"The lesson my experience has taught me," resumed
Furlong, as Dixon escaped up the bank, "is that, so far as
secular things are concerned, the one great fact is the
watchful providence of God, and the one great duty is
unquestioning  submission to  that  providence.  But we<pb n="137"/>
scheme and strive for easier conditions of life -- some for
their fellow-men, others for themselves alone -- forgetting
that 'except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain
that build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman
waketh but in vain.' Psalm cxxvii, 2. We 'forsake the
fountain of living waters and hew ourselves out cisterns,
broken cisterns, that can hold no water.' Jeremiah ii, 13.
The real troubles of life are beyond our control; they are
specially sent for our good; and instead of endeavouring to
evade them, we should accept them as Divine trials of our
individual faith. We rightly call them 'tribulations' -- the
tribulum being the implement used in Palestine for 
separating the corn from the chaff. Poverty is a severe trial, as I
know from experience. Wealth, rightly regarded, is no less
a trial --"

"Gosh! I know which specie I'd ratherest tackle,"
whispered Sam to me, with fictitious jocularity.

"The compilers of the Church of England Service,"
pursued Furlong, "understood this when they wrote: 'In
all time of our tribulation, in all time of our wealth, in the
hour of death, and in the day of judgment -- Good Lord
deliver us.' Soon or late, we have to learn that 'all things
work together for good to them that love God' -- Romans
viii, 28. And the sooner we learn this, the sooner shall our
minds be at rest."

"I'll be off, Harold," said Binney aside to his 
brother-in-law. "Are you coming?"

"Not just yet, George. Stay a minute. We have a 
discovery here."

"A few years ago," continued the unvalued homilist,
wading deeper in his sin, "my own mind was full of error
and discontent, but, like Paul, I met the Lord in the way,
and, like Paul again, I now count all things but loss for the
excellency of the knowledge then vouchsafed to me. I may
say that the original word here translated 'loss' has the
secondary signification of jetsam -- that is, cargo thrown
overboard to save a ship. The idea is that life is a troubled
sea, and each of us a ship seeking the haven of rest. But our<pb n="138"/>
own perverseness leads us to the sinking-point with worldly
theories and compromises, with human predilections and
antipathies, and unless these go overboard, the ship itself
cannot be saved. Paul's dangerous burthen consisted of his
Judaic formula. At the present day, one man's lading may
be ritualism; another's may be hollow enthusiasm; another's
pure worldliness; another's Socialism and Anarchism; but
these must go overboard, or their weight will founder the
ship. 'What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole
world and lose his own soul; or what shall a man give in
exchange for his soul?' Mark viii, 37."

"'Bout time for me to travel, Collins," said Sam, in a
creepful whisper. "I'll see you in the mornin', as you go
past." And he evaporated up the bank, like Old Nick at
the touch of holy water.

"Anyone who fully realises that 'the Most High ruleth
in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever He
will.' --D aniel iv, 25 -- can never waste his energies in 
scheming to overthrow or build up social systems," continued
Furlong, gathering force as he went. "He will rather be a
worker in the field where the harvest is plenteous, and
the labourers few. And anyone who, in the right spirit,
looks back along his own past cannot but confess that an
unseen hand has guided him to the present moment of
time; not only sustaining his life, day by day, but 
interposing hindrances here, compulsions there, benefactions
everywhere -- all which were designed to tend toward
spiritual growth. And He who is the same yesterday, today
and for ever, will continue to sit as a refiner and purifier
of silver -- Malachi iii, 3 -- watching and tending the molten
metal, and removing its dross, till its surface reflects the
face of the Refiner; then it will be taken from the furnace,
as worthy of the treasury. But for those who harden their
hearts, 'sinning wilfully, after they have received 
knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin,
but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery
indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.' Hebrews
x, 26 and 27."<pb n="139"/>

The trapper paused, but an eerie constraint was upon
everyone except Rigby and Lushington. The latter had
from time to time been murmuring cordial acquiescence in
the speaker's views, tacitly encouraging him to continue;
and as for the Colonel, I judged by his attitude that he was
metaphorically sharpening his sword on Furlong's 
doorstep.<pb n="140"/>

"It has been said that man's extremity is God's 
opportunity," continued the trapper fervidly. "I can give an
illustration of this, and it appears to me expedient that I
should do so before we part. I don't wish to force my own
petty history on you, but I think you'll forgive me by the
time I have done.

"I came out from London just after finishing my
apprenticeship as a watchmaker. I'm a poor workman,
partly because I have an unsteady hand, and partly because
of a natural deficiency in mechanical talent. But, until four
years ago, I had never done any work except watchmaking
and enginedriving, and since coming to Australia I had
never spent three successive days outside of Melbourne. I
was married nearly six years ago, and I've been a widower
for four years. My wife was a Melbourne native, and her
only surviving relations were two brothers, both gone up
the country. I found one of them two years ago, and we
kept up a desultory correspondence, but I have never heard
any news of the other."

"Was that the (person) you was after las' year on the
Island?" demanded Dixon, who had ventured back, and
finding the conversation apparently purged from 
spirituality, had seated himself just behind me. "Long-legged, 
yeller-bairded galoot of a bullocky, you said, with a bay horse.
Country's st--nkin' with fellers of that (adj.) description."
"No, Dixon, I've found the man you speak of," replied<pb n="141"/>
the  trapper,  in  a  voice  now  hoarse  with  suppressed
emotion. "Let me go on with my story.

"There is always a good deal of distress somewhere in
the unseen life of a city like Melbourne, and not long
after our marriage the lot fell upon us. I needn't weary
you with the details of our struggle against conditions that
were too strong for us -- the conditions of scanty 
employment and decreasing wages, along with the imperative
need of money for rent and subsistence. City-bred people,
as a rule, can make shift in a city, but exceptions occur, and
these are beyond our control. Laura had a weak chest
through overwork in her younger days, and now her
health began to fail. By this time we had reached the limit
of our credit. I had nothing to sell but a collection of
books, and I parted from these with a regret that seems
strange to me now. Laura grew weaker and weaker, and as
she needed more indulgence the pressure of our poverty
became more severe. No use saying I should have done this
or that; I did everything I could; yet I had to watch her
fading slowly before my eyes, all the while knowing, or at
least believing, that there was health for her, but beyond
my reach. I was an unconverted man at that time, and I
often felt tempted to do something desperate; in fact, 
nothing withheld me but the fear of making matters worse. A
dark shadow seemed to hang over us; we could read in each
other's faces the thought that never left either of us now.
What was most heart-breaking to me was to see her so
resigned. Young as she was, her life had been one long
working-day, and she was tired out. But she had the
Christian's hope. And you must remember that the awful
desolation of the thought that haunted me was made more
bitter by such poverty as it is very unlikely that any of
you have ever experienced. It wasn't like ruin brought on
by some sudden calamity, such as appeals to the sympathy
of the world; it was a chronic insufficiency of everything
needful to life, and nothing for it but to suffer silently.
Yet every moment was so precious to me in those days that
the time seemed to fly."<pb n="142"/>

He paused a moment. I felt tempted to throw something
at him for playing into the Major's hands after such a
fashion. Then he resumed:

"Still there was one hope. A doctor told us that a change
of climate might restore her. He suggested Echuca, or
Riverina, and to take her there at once, as the winter was
coming on. Just then the little furniture we had was seized
for rent, leaving us entirely destitute, and considering
Laura's weak state, I hardly know what we'd have done but
for two friends, a widow and her sister, working together
as laundresses. These good women found room for Laura
in their home. May God bless them for their kindness; here
and hereafter.

"In the meantime I managed to borrow sufficient
money to pay my way, and took the train for Echuca, with
a clinging hope that all these fears and troubles might
soon be past. But I could get no work at my trade there,
though I tried hard. Now, what I should have done was to
have refused, in my own mind, to leave the place till 
something presented itself. No doubt I could in some way have
found a home for Laura there, and, ah well, God's will be
done.

"I went on to Deniliquin. I could get no work there, and
then, confused and desperate as I was, I took the advice of
a very friendly fellow I had fallen in with, and went out to
Moogoojinna station, where there was a chance of getting
charge of a portable engine. I had a second-class certificate,
and I had it with me; yet the opening was so different from
anything I had expected that time after time I stopped, 
half-resolved to turn back. It took me nearly two days to reach
the station, and I felt a kind of relief to learn that the
place was already filled. You wouldn't believe what a
sense of loneliness and desolation comes over a city man
when he sees, under such circumstances as I did, what sort
of place Riverina is. I resolved to try Echuca once more,
hoping for some kind of success. I didn't dare to think of
failure.

"But going back to Deniliquin from Moogoojinna I lost<pb n="143"/>
the track in the dark, and next day, between inexperience
and anxiety of mind, I got completely bewildered on the
plains. I remember that toward evening I found a tank, and
slept beside it all night. At daylight I started in what I
thought was the right direction. I walked all day without
meeting anyone or seeing a habitation, and as evening came
on I reached a tank. Next morning I found it was the
tank I had been at before. I started off again, and at night I
got back to the same tank. How often this was repeated I
cannot say, and how I subsisted during that time I shall
never know. At last a boundary rider found me, barefoot
and bare-headed, half-naked and half-delirious, but still
performing this terrible circuit. He treated me with great
kindness -- I have found opportunity to thank him for it
since -- and as I insisted upon pushing on, after staying a
day and two nights in his hut, he replaced my clothes and
boots, and put me on a beaten track. During the day I had
often to lie down from sheer weakness, but I persevered
until, some time in the night, I found myself close to
Deniliquin; then I turned off the track and slept till 
morning. By this time it was more than a fortnight since I had
left Laura. I had written from Echuca, and also from
Deniliquin, and I knew there would be a reply awaiting me
for some time. When the post-office opened I was handed
a letter and two telegrams. One of the telegrams was four
days old -- 'Return immediately. Laura seriously ill.' The
other, dated sixteen hours before the time of delivery -- 
'Come home. Laura sinking fast.' I must have dropped the
letter; I remember nothing of it except receiving it.

"I walked to the railway station, penniless as I was,
and in desperation told my story to the first porter I met.
He could do nothing for me. I went to some men loading
wagons at the goods shed, but they were too busy to
listen to me. I saw a buggy and pair standing at the gate,
and an old gentleman approaching it from the goods sheds
office. I stopped him, with the most humble apologies. He
read my telegrams, and listened attentively to what I had
to say; then when I finished by begging the railway fare to<pb n="144"/>
Melbourne, he told me that if there were a policeman in
sight he would give me in charge. No doubt I looked 
disreputable, and of course an impostor could have told the
same story in the same way; but the refusal nearly broke
my heart. I made no further appeal to anyone. My last
glimpse of hope was gone; my last vestige of courage
was gone; and, without any intention or plan, I started
southward on foot, weak and knocked-up as I was.

"I walked along the Echuca road, mile after mile, like
one in a horrible, indefinite dream, waking now and then
to realise that I was two hundred miles from Laura, and
that she was dying, or dead. Gradually, I remember, this
numbness of mind gave way to one consciousness -- the
consciousness of utter isolation, of treading the winepress
alone. Terrible as my extremity was, I could do nothing -- 
nothing -- to help myself; and I began to see the 
unreasonableness of expecting from anyone else such help as I
needed. Then I remembered Laura's simple trust in an
infinite Wisdom, an Immeasurable Love, watching over
each one of us continually. This, once for all, brought me
face to face with the alternatives of faith and infidelity. I
struggled against asking myself whether this fearful trouble
was consistent with Divine love; but I felt that if Christ
were on earth I could appeal to Him with confidence that
He would help me, and even this thought brought comfort
and peace. You may call it a mere mental reaction; no
doubt it was something of the kind; but the moment of
that reaction was the moment of my conversion.

"Still I felt no abatement of the desperate impulse to
hurry on. My limbs were racked with pain and weariness;
but my face was turned toward where Laura lay, alive or
dead, and it was impossible to rest for one moment. So
hour after hour passed, while I walked eighteen or twenty
miles, unconscious of anything around. Then comes a
definite recollection. I live it over again every night when
I am alone with the memories of the past.

"I seem half-conscious of a dull aching in my limbs, and
a burning pain in the soles of my feet as I walk on. Someone<pb n="145"/>
calls me repeatedly; and I look round to see, beside the
road, a man lying in the shade of a tree, with a newspaper
in his hand; two wagons close by, and behind one of them
a bay horse, feeding out of a box. The man calls me again.
I go across to him, and sink down in the shade, sick and
giddy --"

"Oh, never mind that," interrupted Thompson. "How
did you find -- how -- how was it when you got to 
Melbourne?" As he spoke, an ungainly self-consciousness was
plainly struggling with emotion in his tone. Indeed, between
shifting restlessly on his seat, and absently feeling his
pocket, he had betrayed an increasing uneasiness ever
since Furlong got fairly under way with his depressing
tale.

"My dear friend," replied the trapper, in a tremulous
voice, "you must allow me to tell the story in my own
way. After I had taken a drink of tea and some food,
Thompson asked me if -- well, he asked me if I had been
drinking. I began to tell him my trouble, but, in spite of
myself, I broke down completely. I could do nothing but
hand him the two telegrams. He read them two or three
times.

"'Your wife?' says he.

"I tried to speak, but couldn't.

"He jumped to his feet, looked at his watch, and put
the saddle and bridle on his horse.

"'Here, quick,' says he; 'follow this track straight and
it'll take you to Mathoura. Here's money for you' -- and he
sorted out some notes, and put them in my hand. I mounted,
and he altered the stirrups to my length, and buckled his
spur on my heel. 'Keep at a good smart canter, and you'll
catch the train,' says he. 'But if she's up to time, you haven't
got a minute to spare. Hitch the horse anywhere about
the station, or jump off and let him go. Don't speak to me.
Everything is understood between us.'

"To my unspeakable relief I was in time for the train,
and, a few minutes afterward, I was on my way to
Melbourne. Then the physical reaction came. I felt a<pb n="146"/>
sudden sickness, with a ringing in my ears, and I seemed to
be falling, falling, falling hundreds of feet. My last thought
was that I might die before reaching Laura, and, even with
the help of my fellow-passengers, I only recovered as the
train stopped at Moama. From Echuca I sent a telegram,
and about midnight I reached the home of our two friends.

"Mrs Lacy met me at the door, and told me what to
expect. During some terribly cold weather a few days
before, Laura had taken a turn, and from that time there
was no hope. But now she was restored to me for a few
hours longer, and this seemed the greatest blessing life
could bestow. She was perfectly sensible, breathing slowly
and faintly, and such a smile passed over her white, spiritual
face as she saw me beside her. I remember, more and more,
every syllable she whispered, so soft and low, for her voice
was gone.

"'I knew you were coming, Frank,' she said. 'I prayed
continually that you might be near me at the last. This is
not what we looked forward to; but it is the best. We've
suffered together, my poor love, but that's past for me
now; it will soon be past for you -- and then think of the
everlasting rest of us both. I'll be waiting for you in that
new home, as I've waited for you so often in times past;
and when you come, I'll never feel my heart breaking for
your troubles, as I have so often here. And you'll give 
yourself to Christ -- now -- now -- for my sake, and be faithful to
the end, dear love, so as to meet me where there shall be
no more pain, or weariness, or sorrow.'

"From time to time, she whispered half-sentences and
disconnected words, but at last her calm eyes rested on my
face, and she said:

"'My poor lonely love, don't mourn when you see the
grave close over me. Our parting is only for a time. Our
Redeemer has travelled the path before us, and made the
way sure. O Frank, what we call death is the exceeding
great reward. It is sweet to feel the world pass away, with
all its cares and sorrows, leaving me to rest with Christ.'"<pb n="147"/>

The trapper caught his breath and paused, then resumed
in a low, steady tone:

"And so, holding one of my hands with both of hers,
she seemed to sink into a dreamy state, but sometimes I felt
her move her fingers, to assure herself that my hand was
still there; sometimes she half-opened her eyes, and smiled
as she saw me beside her. At last I heard her whisper
softly; bent over to catch the words:

"'Our Father Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy
name; Thy kingdom come.' That was all. She slowly
opened her eyes, and fixed them on my face, and gave one
little sigh. I waited for her to breathe again -- waited -- but
her fingers closed on mine, and slowly relaxed; then I saw
the light fade from her eyes; a look of perfect repose settled
on her face -- an appalling tranquillity; she was insensible to
my affliction."

He paused abruptly.

For a few minutes we listened to the frogs in the river flats,
and the monotonous barking of a dog up at the pub, and
the occasional jangle of a bell away in the dark shadows of
the bend. The gentle sport of the evening -- previously
poisoned by Thompson's unconscious disclosure -- was by
this time almost forgotten. Seats had, one by one, been
selected in sociable proximity, and now nothing but a sense
of decorum kept our lines in the river. Presently Furlong,
crumpling his hat in his hand, dipped up a drink of water
with the rim, and went on with his story --

"Now, my friends, if you think this was distressing, just
try to conceive what it would have been if I hadn't met
Thompson. It was he that brought me to my wife's 
death-bed, to make her last moments happy; it was he that saved
her from a pauper's grave. Oh, Thompson, you must meet
us both in that better land, where troubles and sorrowful
memories are unknown, and all is peace and purity and
love. My poor wife never knew in life, but she knows now,
whose kindness it was that fulfilled her last wish. And for
myself -- without even knowing your name, I have prayed
for you daily all these years past." Here the trapper's
emotion overcame him again, while the sullen hang-dog
demeanour of the bullock driver became more pronounced.<pb n="149"/>
But, after a minute's pause, Furlong continued, speaking
now in a perfectly composed tone -- 

"When I looked my last at Laura as she lay in her coffin
with that angel-look on her face, I calmly asked myself
whether I would recall her if I had the power. No, I would
not. I was desolate as any castaway on a rock in mid-ocean,
but desolation mattered little to me from that time forward,
and there was a never-failing solace in the knowledge that
her gentle spirit had found eternal rest, and that those poor
worn hands, crossed on her breast, had done their last
earthly work. I knew the time was coming when the 
assurance of her everlasting safety would outweigh my own
sense of loneliness, and that time came long ago. Now that
I've met you, Thompson, I haven't one personal anxiety in
the world. I am a happy man tonight."

"We all sympathise with you, I'm sure," remarked the
kindly clergyman, with a huskiness in his voice. "But you
are doubly happy in having found the pearl of great price,
and it must crown your happiness to have the assurance
that your loved one is safe. You are doing well enough now,
I trust, from a worldly point of view?"

"Right enough," replied the trapper, indifferently. "In
former times I never imagined that there could be such an
opening for me, or any occupation that suited me so well.
I'll finish my story in a few words. I turned away from
Melbourne with a small kit of tools in my hand, and a few
shillings in my pocket, leaving debts behind me to the
amount of about twenty-six pounds. My intention was to
go round the farms in the Northern District, cleaning and
repairing, but after a few weeks I took to trapping, and in
course of time paid off my debts, besides buying a suitable
turnout. Then I went into other things, feeling my way
carefully. I travel over a good deal of country, always doing
something. I'm averaging about a hundred and forty
pounds a year now, and it costs very little to keep me.
Puny as I am, I should have been a bushman."

"I'll say this for you," interposed Dixon, "you're the
only feller o' your size I ever see that ain't et up with<pb n="150"/>
conceit, an' I dunno one (adj.) man -- not if he was fifteen
stone -- that gits over his work with such credit as you do.
You're like the bloke in the disturbance -- 'I'm little,' says
he, 'but, O God.'"

"Mis-ter Dix-on," exclaimed Lushington, naturally
shocked.

"Beg parding," replied the vessel of wrath, adroitly 
veiling his non-apprehension under the mask of urbanity. "Slipt
out unbeknownst. Sort o' *lapsus* (adj.) *linguae*. I'm a 
careless (fellow), but I don't mean nothin' wrong."

"And you ought to be on your guard. But, Mr Furlong,
I'm glad to hear of your release from the pressure of
poverty. A blessing always attends perseverance in the end.
You'll be able to lay by a nice little sum as a provision
for the future."

"Well," replied Furlong, with some constraint, "I'm 
owing Thompson twelve pounds, and --"

"No, no," interrupted Thompson, sourly.

"And I can only pay him about half, and ask him to
wait till I earn the rest. You may think it strange that I've
been inquiring for him all these years, and never reserved
his money, though I've had hundreds through my hands.
The fact is, that -- that -- But what use is money to me now?"

"So it was Thompson you was inquirin' about when I
seen you on the Island?" interposed Dixon. "Well, I be
(lost). Why the (sheol) didn't you say a (person) with a
ches'nut horse? Not a bay. Thompson's remarked for
ches'nut ever since I knowed him."

"Any other color's unlucky with me," observed
Thompson sadly. "And to prove it -- I only had that bay
horse for three weeks. Got his hind foot over the 
hobble-chain drinking at a steep place. Fact, it's as much as I can
do to keep even a ches'nut horse."

"I must have a talk with you on that subject," replied
Lushington. "We shall meet again, and I hope, learn 
something from each other. I should feel sorry to lose sight of a
man like you. But, Furlong, I feel really concerned for you.
Do you think -- if I may be so personal -- that you are morally<pb n="151"/>
justified in shutting your eyes to the future now that you
have opportunity to provide for the old age which, I trust,
you will be spared to see? Pardon me for saying that I
think you should accept your past experience as an evidence
of what may happen again when you will be less able to
battle with the world than in your younger days. Believe
me, I appreciate unselfishness as a principle, but you should
be just before you are generous. You ought to reserve
something. You owe it to yourself."

"Well," replied Furlong, hesitatingly, "I have a kind of
provision. It may appear foolish to you, and I won't
attempt to justify it. The grave where my wife lies is
secured and registered, and I have made arrangements for
being buried there with her. It rests with God alone to
determine the period of my life and the conditions and
place of my death, but when that time comes, those who
undertake my burial will find instructions as to my wishes,
and a sum of thirty pounds to repay their trouble and
expense. The money is safe in the Mercantile Bank,
deposited there for that express purpose, and it cannot be
drawn until certain incontestable proofs are forthcoming
to show that the trust has been fulfilled. I needn't go into
the details of the arrangements now, but they are as 
complete as I could make them. So you see, Mr Lushington,"
continued the trapper, deprecatingly, "I'm a little more
selfish than I had led you to believe."

"Now, Furlong, you place me in a painful position. It
was with the best intention, and in view of your loneliness
in the world, that I threw out the suggestion. I meant it
kindly. And all that you have since said makes me only the
more solicitous to see you provide for coming years. Now,
a series of periodical payments into the Endowment Fund
of an Assurance Society, in which I have some interest,
would in due time give you a good return, and would much
increase your power of usefulness in more advanced life.
Shall we talk the matter over quietly tomorrow? I have no<pb n="152"/>
commercial motive in proposing it, but I should like to see
you safe."

The trapper maintained an uneasy silence. Obstinate in
some ways, he was manifestly a man averse to argument.
But there was another member of our congregation who,
though still more obstinate, had no such antipathy to the
intellectual duello.

- himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth

- {:.indent-6}III John, 9, 10.
{:.poetry}


"Furlong is safe -- if his Bible is worth the paper it is
printed on," said the deep resonant voice of the American.
"All your financial societies, based on usury as they are,
will go to the Father of Usury sooner or later -- most of
them sooner -- unless my judgment is strangely at fault. But
the postulated president of Furlong's society has given a
guarantee which, if not passed over as the wildest 
extravagance, must be accepted as a pledge that will outlast the
solar system. 'And even to your old age, I am he; and even
to hoar hairs I will carry you; I have made, and I will bear;
even I will carry you, and will deliver you.' This warranty
is repeated in a hundred forms throughout the so-called
later revelation, and, most emphatically of all, by Christ
Himself. Let Furlong be consistent in his working out of
the economic problem on Biblical lines. His experiment is
being carried out in the spirit of confiding assent; not as a
challenge, nor even as a test; and such enterprises are of
supreme interest in a mercenary age."

"But, Mr Rigby, I think you take me unfairly," 
protested the clergyman. "I am entirely with Furlong in full
and implicit reliance on divine goodness; still, we must
provide things needful in the sight of all men -- another
way of saying that thrift is an essential of the Christian
character. You will surely agree with me in the duty of
providing for the future?"

"No," replied the Deacon emphatically. "The only duty<pb n="154"/>
that I personally recognise is the very momentous one of
forwarding the New Order. Don't wilfully misconstrue me
here or confuse the issue by a shifting signification of the
word 'thrift'. Remember, I hold that a man's best work,
cheerfully rendered in compensation for his livelihood, is
a primary component of the comprehensive duty I speak
of. I hold the idler as being already in the nethermost pit
of infamy -- not so much the idler under the bridge, as the
idler in the drawing-room at Toorak or Potts Point -- and I
hold the prodigal, of high or low degree, as almost equally
infamous. So I trust that we agree on the naked question of
'thrift'. Honest, cheerful work, for the sustenance and
enrichment and enlightenment of the world, we both admit
to be a duty -- but why tack on to this obligation the 
altogether alien idea of accumulation? What a despicable 
subterfuge it is to attempt to carry avarice on the back of
industry and economy along the narrow way. Why strive
so hard to combine the sense of property with the sense of
duty, as if neither could justify itself without the other?
Why not allow each to find, or fail to find, its own separate
vindication? Just where you differ from Furlong, Mr 
Lushington, you must permit me to differ from you. But from
this point onward, Furlong and I diverge very widely.
Still, I don't despair of showing him that, in toleration of
a social system from which he has suffered so much, he
falls into the most fatal form of Antinomianism -- namely, a
sacrilegious demand upon the goodness of God to release
us from the effects of our own headstrong repudiation of
His kingdom's secular side. On the other hand, Furlong's
faith is like a grain of mustard seed in the ground, while
mine is like a spore of fern seed under a microscope. The
petition, 'Give us this day our daily bread' carries a vital
meaning to Furlong; to you, it is a mere figure of speech,
redeemed from puerility by its sacred associations; to me, I
am sorry to say, it is little more than a sublime study. But
even so, I can't express my contempt for the idea of 
believing in God, and at the same time taking the precautions
against His providence. Here, again, a mere statement of<pb n="155"/>
the truth lays me open to misconstruction. 'Precautions' is
such an elastic word. In justice to my argument, I must ask
you to enlist the common sense which you would bring
to bear upon the discussion of any indifferent subject. Also,
we must assume the question to be impersonal, and that
we are now speaking of the professing Christian at large.
Consider, then, for a moment how this suppositious 
Christian stands, even according to his own showing. He is
authorised to ask nothing in the way of temporal provision
beyond his daily bread; does anyone deny that? Before him
is a future which he can neither see nor control; does 
anyone deny that? And beside him and around him are 
destitution, helplessness, and ignorance; does anyone deny that?
Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath
made ruler over his household, to -- to do what? To call the
property his own, and lay it past for his own uninteresting
old age? By no means. But to give his fellow-servants meat
in due season -- and this due season I assume to be the most
persistently present era of life. Your professional 
Bible-perverter will, of course, tell you that the passage refers to
spiritual meat. Spiritual rot. In the name of decency, let us
avoid cheap and nasty doctrine; in the name of honesty let
us concede that the precept refers solely to 
stewardship of secular things; and if you think I'm giving too much
prominence to the worldly side of Christian life, just try
to realize what an important place that worldly side holds
in your own estimation. Think how shamelessly you 
equivocate along this line; how wistfully you fence and shuffle
and quibble with the question; think how insidiously you
suppress, or misinterpret, the frank behests of the code you
all the while long to obey; anything -- *anything* -- to secure
your temporal affairs in your own reliable keeping, and
shelve your shrivelled moral nature upon God's goodness.
But it can't be done, Mr Lushington. I'm speaking 
straight-forwardly to you, because I plainly perceive that you take
some interest in what passes current for Christianity. Now
I'll show you an apparent paradox, but a vital truth 
notwithstanding; an arrangement or regulation, strictly <pb n="156"/>
Scriptural, undeniably rational, and therefore well worth 
thinking over. It is this: the secular side of life belongs to God,
and the spiritual side to man -- still remembering that 
cheerful compliance with the penalty of labor is a most essential
part of this spiritual life. The earth is the Lord's -- Nature's,
if you will, for we won't quarrel over terms. The Power
behind Evolution -- the Power which controls the million
operations of natural law -- the Power which, from season
to season, keeps up the world's food-ration, yet never has
supplied, nor will supply, a two-years' stock for all eaters
 -- is something beyond man. But man's moral nature -- such
as his institutions may have made it -- is his own, without
any reservation whatsoever. We are all Goethes -- not in
respect of literary ability, perhaps, but in respect that we
never heard of a crime that we might not have committed.
Say, if you will, with Gloster, in *Lear*: 'As flies to wanton
boys are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport.'
Granted. But that is the limit of their province; they cannot
disturb your Individualistic principles, nor my Socialistic
fads. Jehovah, through Moses, may enlist and exercise the
most formidable --"

"He's fairly started," whispered Thompson to me.

"Not yet," I replied, in the same tone. "This is only a
preliminary canter, but he'll start by-and-bye."

"-- agencies of Nature; but he cannot soften Pharoah's
heart when that copper-coloured probationer chooses to
harden it. Canute, by his own moral volition, could damn
himself -- and probably did so -- though he couldn't dam the
tide; his soul was his own, the tide was God's. Any man
may develop his own moral nature, upward or downward
 -- each unit of society being personally responsible for the
conditions under which the development of each takes
place -- but no man can add eighteen inches to his own
height; and this last metaphor is the one used by Christ
himself to illustrate the utter irreverency of anxiety for
the morrow."

"You take me in a too violent sense, Mr Rigby," replied
the clergyman, gently. "Let me put the issue before you<pb n="157"/>
with a frankness for which I solicit pardon beforehand,
pleading only that the *argumentum ad hominem* 
between --"

"Stick to that, young feller," broke in Dixon. "Foller
him up on them (adj.) lines."

"-- between you and me, at least, does not originate on
my side. I presume from your tone that your habit has not
been to provide for the future, and I should imagine you
to possess independence of spirit which is a very admirable
quality. Now suppose that, from the present day, your
health and strength fail rapidly -- and, pardon me, Mr
Rigby, you are no longer a young man. The decline of life
is inevitable, if we are spared to experience it:

- {:.indent-3}From Marlborough's eyes the streams of dotage flow,
- {:.indent-3}And Swift expires a driveller and a show."
{:.poetry}

"Which proves in a more literal sense than Solomon 
intended," said I, "that the race is not to the swift nor the
battle to the strategist."

"Neatly put, Collins," rejoined Lushington. "But, Mr
Rigby, you see that your extreme views place you in a
difficult position?"

"A man's life's no more than to say one," replied the
Senator, gravely. "Notice how my extreme views release me
from the position they place me in? When my right hand
forgets the exceedingly little cunning it ever possessed, it
will still retain dexterity enough to load and fire a pistol.
I object to suicide, but only as I object to any other evasion
of duty, and I condemn the act exactly as I condemn any
other infliction of distress or loss upon those with whom
I come in touch. But, in the first place, we presuppose my
last task completed, and, in the second place, my 
unsettled and solitary life has naturally cancelled any claim
to the tributary tear. I take no higher ground. Didn't I
acknowledge that my religious faith was invisible to the
naked eye?"

"What a penalty," murmured Lushington, in real 
commiseration.<pb n="158"/>

"There is no procedure, right or wrong, but has its
accordant penalty," replied the Major. "I daresay that, in
the normal sequence of effort and result, it has been within
my power to have become a comparatively warm man.
But such a condition was opposed to my interests. Let me
explain this, even at the risk of appearing egotistic -- a
weakness which, Heaven knows, is no besetment of mine.
An apostle of the New Order, Mr Lushington, must meet
all prospective and actual adherents on a common plane,
and the only plane available is that of simple manhood.
Think over it. Who teaches poor men must himself be
poor. Not only that, but he must refuse all private 
advantage; he must persist in poverty. 'Axe to grind' is the
most deadly charge ever brought against an avowed 
champion of truth and progress. And the agitator's only 
safeguard against this aspersion is non-possession of any axe,
except the implement which he sedulously applies to the
root of this or that social upas. See how this elementary
necessity has been recognised by the makers of real 
history -- that is, the history of moral advance. If Gautama, for
instance, would put his impress on a race he must 
voluntarily exchange the degree of a prince for that of the
poorest peasant. If Christ would transform the world He
must have not whereon to lay His head. If Mahomet would
promulgate a creed and found a civilisation he must be
seen at the zenith of his power mending his own shoes;
he must habitually saddle his camel with his own hands;
and if his successor, Abu-Bekr, would complete the work
the Prophet began he must not only vie with his poorest
followers in plainness of living, but must once in every
week leave himself absolutely moneyless. If Wesley would
inaugurate the greatest religious departure of modern times
he must be as poor as Elijah or St Paul; he must be able
to say: 'If I die worth ten pounds, let posterity pronounce
John Wesley a hypocrite and an impostor.' As in religion
proper, so in moral science. If Zeno would found the
noblest of all schools of ethic philosophy he must teach
all day, and by starlight earn his morrow's bread. If Plato<pb n="159"/>
would enlighten the world he must die possessed of no gold
except his ear rings. If Epictetus would point succeeding
ages to a manlier life he must leave no property beyond his
little earthenware lamp. And so on to infinity. Becket in
cloth-of-gold was a mere butterfly; but in hair-cloth he
was formidable. All that ministers to lust of the eyes or the
pride of life (and here you have a very large order), is
fatal to the kind of personal influence a moral leader must
exercise. Aurelius was more distinguished by the simplicity,
the hardness, the actual poverty, of his life, than by the
exalted office he bore solely for the good of his fellow-men,
and the air of falsity which pervades the teachings of
Seneca is only too easily accounted for by his private
wealth. At least ninety per cent of would-be reformers
have stultified themselves by drifting into extraneous 
personal advantage. Here, for instance, we have the secret of
Rienzi's failure. I purposely mix religion, ethics and 
sociology in this inquiry, because they correlatively cover so
much ground that nothing worth quarrelling over is left
in the separate domain of any. It amounts to this: that the
man of substance, however he may otherwise serve 
society, can never do so as a leader in religion or morals, never
as a champion of popular rights, never as a reformer."

"That would shut out such men as Nicodemus and
Joseph of Arimathea," interposed Binney.

"As religious or social-economic reformers it certainly
would," assented the Deacon. "Mind, I don't mean to say
that -- taking the men as they are presented to us -- the
Lazarus of the parable was better than either of the two
you have named. We are dealing with special qualifications
for a certain task, not with comparative righteousness. I
am not presumptive enough even to assert that Lazarus
was morally better than the well-to-do gentleman in the
same parable. I merely contend that Joseph of Arimathea
must have qualified for his traditional mission to Britain
by becoming as poor as Lazarus. Touching Nicodemus,
we infer, from certain passages in the Talmud, that he lived
a member of the Sanhedrim wealthy and respected, till the<pb n="160"/>
fall of Jerusalem somewhat disturbed his family succession.
Doubtless he was admitted to Abraham's bosom as well as
Lazarus -- but that is not the point. The point is, that having
declined to take degrees as a reformer, he missed the 
reformer's record."

"As achieved by the individual who now stands before
us," I remarked.

"If a farthing in the pound can be called liquidation,
Tom," replied the Senator, dejectedly.

## CHAPTER XXX

- Without a master or a guide,
- To stem the fierce barbaric tide.

"Keep the ball rollin' anyhow," urged Dixon. "Ain't of'en
a lot o' blokes like us gits together. We don't kill a pig
every (adj.) day."

"Well, speaking for myself," continued the Judge, "I
consider that the privilege of poverty is worth about forty
million times as much to me as any little personal 
provision which I might have been able, or might still be able,
to segregate from the public estate. Understand clearly that
I have no personal grievance against society; my only fear
is that society may have a grievance against me, and I feel
bound to guard against that danger. For instance, I hold
that every man should have a home of his own, inviolable
and independent, but for that very reason I decline to have
one whilst better men are homeless. And now see where
my spore of fern-seed comes into operation. Generally
speaking, I have no fear of being driven to the extremity
I hinted at just now. When I consider the finished career
of those who have gone before, and note how gratuitous
was all their solicitude, my mind is at rest. Take Burns, the
poet and spokesman of human nature, as a representative
of his race, and think what agonies of apprehension racked
that man's soul, to no purpose whatever. The 
poverty-stricken octogenarian he talked with on the banks of Ayr
was his own morbid presage of his future self. He envied
the field-mouse its exemption from his own forebodements.
Why should he? He never saw his thirty-seventh birthday,<pb n="162"/>
and he left the world incalculably his debtor -- an obligation
which the world acknowledged, twenty-five years ago, by
giving him the greatest centenary in history. No doubt,
he had hard times -- thanks to the criminal blindness of his
forefathers -- but his mere anxiety didn't mend matters, and
his honest protest has made times better for us, just as our
protest should make times better for our successors. 
Thinking over these things, I feel thankful that the work allotted
to me as a co-operator with the Power in whom we live,
and move, and have our being, is of a much more tangible
kind than the providing against the indefinite by means of
the elusive. Hence my habitual process of thought leads me
to settle down into a conspicuously imperfect performance
of what I conceive to be the programme of duty, feeling
fairly confident that I shall never be condemned to lag
superfluous on the pay-sheet."

"Thou art not far from the Kingdom of Heaven," 
remarked Furlong gently. "But, dear Mr Rigby, you strike
the rock as Moses did, instead of speaking to it in the name
of the Lord. It seems to me," he continued with some
hesitation, "that your misfortune is want of humility and
teachableness."

"Yes; he's got a bit of a vacancy there, right enough,"
assented Thompson ill-naturedly.

"I don't wish to force my view upon anyone," resumed
Furlong, "but here is what seems to me a reasonable way
of looking at the position we all occupy on this earth. We
know that there was a time in each of our lives when we
were utterly helpless; but God had a place and a use, and
a provision, for each one of us; therefore, we passed the
feebleness of that time, and here we are tonight. Now;
can we fear that the Almighty arm which shielded our
infancy may become paralysed in our age? That is all. The
more we attempt to explain away the providence of God,
the weaker will our arguments appear. Church tradition,
you know, tells of a blind centenarian, led from time to
time into the assembly of the disciples at Ephesus, to
deliver the charge, 'Little children, love one another.' Was<pb n="163"/>
St John superannuated even then? No, according to
promise, his age was clearer than the noonday. Can we
ever be superannuated in the sight of Him who holds our
lives in His hand to be resumed when He sees fit?"

"Certainly we can," replied the Colonel promptly, while
Furlong writhed on his seat. "St John was an exception.
He wasn't superannuated, simply because in the days of
his vigor he had never courted superannuation. It is an
aphorism somewhat hyperbolical, I admit -- that any man,
if he is prepared to pay the price, will attain whatever
reasonable end he keeps in view; and to most of us 
superannuation is the chief aim and object of life. Naturally,
then, the person who anticipates a worthless old age, and
provides for it accordingly, ensures the fulfilment of his
forecast as far as the worthlessness is concerned, though in
so doing he defeats the utility of his enterprise; for the
moral discipline entailed by his life-work inevitably 
produces an old age not worth providing for. And that man
is superannuated in the sight of his Maker, as well as in
the sight of his fellow-men."

"*Memento* (adj.) *mori*" observed Dixon appreciatively.
"Course, while a man's beltin' his way through the world,
he can't expect to be every (adj.) thing the doctor ordered;
but when he makes a sort o' rise he ought to repent. Got
to die some time, right enough. Thank Mister (adj.) Adam
for that lot. By (sheol)---!"

"Good enough for us," mourned Thompson.

"Death," rejoined the Commodore critically, "is no more
a serious occurrence than the word 'finis' at the end of a
book; which book, long or short, decent, vile or mediocre,
as the case may be, cannot possibly contain anything of
permanent importance except a record of trusteeship. By
the same token, it usually embodies nothing but a scheme
of embezzlement, seldom successfully pulled off."

"But trustees must live during the currency of their
office," suggested the tenacious clergyman.

"A most reasonable claim," conceded the Sheriff. "But
pardon me, you seem to insist upon something beyond that<pb n="164"/>
legitimate demand. Let us get at the facts. We lived in the
last decade, in the last year, in the last week. We are
living now. But we are not living in the coming week, in
the coming year, in the coming decade. Now human nature
dreads the temporal future. There is no getting away from
that fact. And to this anxiety some one of three widely
diverse palliatives is applied. Shall we examine these 
consecutively? The worldling pulls down his barns, and builds
greater -- or looks forward to doing so. That is the purely
secular provision, which is persistently and unmistakably
condemned by the founder of the religion we casually
profess. Then the Stoic, esteeming all material things as
merely auxiliary to self-centred integrity, holds himself
prepared to withdraw from the world, rather than become
an encumbrance. That is the purely heroic provision, and I
confess it has a certain fascination. Lastly, the Christian,
concerning himself only with the obligations of life, whilst
enjoying its blameless amenities, calmly reposes on the
abundant promises contained in that book which he accepts
as Divine revelation. That provision is beyond comment,
inasmuch as its seeming precariousness never disturbs the
confidence of its true partisans. But Furlong has just now
said the last word on this attitude of mind. However, these
three courses absolutely exhaust the elective possibilities of
life. Socialism, of course, simply aims at realising the 
Christian's provision, per medium of an endowment policy
endorsed by the whole community. Meantime, a man may
select any one of the three courses I have quoted, but not
a combination. Which two can you combine?"

"Any sensible bloke, if he were restricted to one course,
would select damper and bacon, as being both wholesome
and filling," I observed. "And if you could take statistics
of the whole human race I fancy you would find a very
large number who never trouble themselves over any other
consideration. Others, like your hero, Fritz, care for
nothing beyond looking upon the tanglefoot when it is
long."

"Speak gently of the dead," replied the Colonel gravely.<pb n="165"/>
"All living men possess the faculty -- perverted or otherwise
 -- of forecast. Scratch the apparently happy-go-lucky, and
you may count upon finding one of my three characters -- 
generally the worldling, sometimes the Stoic, occasionally
(and mostly among women) the Christian. Your 
observation would apply with more force to a bygone age, when
the would-be worldling was held in his place by the large,
flat foot of Privilege; and the would-be Stoic was kept in
working order by the threat of having his soul firmly staked
down in the bottomless pit, and his body at the nearest
cross-roads; while the would-be Christian was cleverly
thrown on the herring-scent of royalty, nobility and 
gentry. Many corpses walk the earth at the present day, no
doubt; but, broadly speaking, every living person, from
fifteen years old and upward, belongs to one of the three
classes. Leaving the Stoic out, we now judge between the
worldling and the Christian -- between the man who lays
up treasure in the shape of property, by exertions on his
own behalf, and the man who lays it up in the shape of
a life's record, by exertions on behalf of others. I 
maintain that no man can make the two investments conjointly,
and I have the argument of congruity with me, not to
speak of the four evangelists. The difficulty of the question
arises simply from trying to blend two policies, not merely
foreign, but mutually hostile to each other. You will 
remember, Mr Lushington, that you have just now 
congratulated Furlong upon having found the pearl of great price?
Why, you hardly touched the metaphor. Follow it out
honestly, and see where it lands you. I say, Furlong, can
you repeat the passage, word for word?"

The trapper cleared his throat. "'Again the kingdom of
heaven is like unto a merchantman seeking goodly pearls,
who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went
and sold all that he had and bought it.' Matthew xiii, 45
and 46." 

"Thank you," replied the Judge. "You will perceive,
Mr Lushington, that the point brought out is not the
discovery of the pearl, but the price cheerfully paid for it.<pb n="166"/>
Undoubtedly, from the Samuel Smiles' point of view, this
pearl trading is a fanatical speculation. Samuel's 
pig-philosophy requires a new exegesis of the gospels -- an 
exegesis explaining that Christ was merely giving a lesson in
social etiquette when, in a parable, He charged His 
followers, on being bidden to a feast, to sit down in the lowest
place, and so forth. Yet the metaphor is an exceedingly
happy one, for the effort to rise personally in the world
merely amounts to an indecent rush for the front seat.
Just analyse the figure of speech for yourselves, and its
completeness will grow upon you." The Senator paused a
moment to let his noisome teaching soak in.

"Christians," continued the Commodore, genially. "Yes,
you quote and preach from Paul, and canonise his
ephemeral correspondence, because you feel him to be a
less exacting taskmaster than Christ. But you daren't 
follow even Paul: 'Art thou called, being a servant (literally,
slave) seek not to be free, for he that is a servant is the
Lord's freeman.' Will you assent to that requisition? What
fools you would be. Did you ever hear a clergyman charge
his congregation to the effect that each of them must
entirely forgo his own personal interests, as a guarantee of
fidelity to the public good? You never did. Yet 
Christianity demands nothing less. And the only reward is that ye
shall be the children of the Highest. No points in it. Say,
rather, that there is no God but Thrift, and Smiles is his
prophet." The Major laughed gently, then continued:
"However, Smiles is not the prophet of that inexorable
law which decrees that whosoever exalteth himself shall be
abased, and he that humbleth himself be exalted, an 
ordinance, by the way, which is not to be fully explained while
you wait. Samuel is a barely perceptible insect on the 
fly-wheel of the mill which grinds slowly, yet exceedingly
small. I have no quarrel with the infidel here, I challenge
only the so-called Christian -- the man whose religion never
was designed to make his profits less.

"And I don't presume to condemn candid, outspoken
apostasy," continued the Deacon, forbearingly, "but on
behalf of all honest inquiries, I condemn the varnish of<pb n="168"/>
truth which disguises that apostasy. Each of you has heard
more than one clergyman maunder to the effect that a
good moral life is not enough, for our righteousness is but
as filthy rags; that a belief in Christ is not enough, for the
devils believe and tremble; that, in fact, nothing short of
the one thing needful will suffice. Then the shepherd has
pronounced his benediction, and you have gone your way,
inwardly deploring the ambiguity of the plan of salvation,
and half-inclined to resent its apparent absurdity, yet not
daring to pronounce it bogus. Finally, your only grain
of comfort is found in a life-expectation of a dozen, or two
dozen, or three dozen years, with the example of the
penitent thief as an ultimate stand-by. My dear boys, your
pastor dare no more urge this missing condition upon your
acceptance than he dare place himself in the labor market
on his own merits. In a sense he is not to blame. His office
is to condemn evil; his business is to condone worldliness;
and his professional training has taught him to regard as
loose hyperbole the pregnant axiom that 'the love of money
(for any purpose whatever) is the root of all evil'."

Lushington, as an overmatched man, was by this time
carrying the sympathy of the meeting, though only Binney
and I were aware of his personal claims to reverence. But
he couldn't let well alone. He now proceeded to earn our
mental execration by a platitude too childish for any 
layman's utterance.

"It is the *love* of money, Mr Rigby, that is condemned,
not the due esteem of its beneficent potency. Money, like
most other things, has its use, and its abuse."

"True," conceded the Sheriff, whose good wit, like
Falstaff's, turned everything to commodity. "Its use is to
serve as a simplifying counter in exchange of merchandise
or service; its abuse is to serve as representing wealth. We
all know how hard it is to separate the two aspects, and to
hold them distinct. Yet this must be done if we would
keep our moral vision clear. And where the vindication of
money *per se* is promptly to the fore, the love is not far
off. Once temporise with the Christian principle of <pb n="169"/>
Mammon renunciation -- once concede the appreciation of money
as property -- and you open the door to evasions without
end. This relapse has taken place throughout Christendom;
hence your most bitterly antagonistic churches stand
shoulder to shoulder in suppression of the distasteful and
costly truth. Yet you have been solemnly warned that you
cannot serve God and -- not Ashtoreth, nor Belial, nor
Moloch, nor the patron-god of any non-paying vice; such
an admonition would have been superfluous; but it scarcely
needed a Divine prescience to forecast the likelihood of a
divided duty toward God and Mammon. Further, my dear
fellow imbeciles, it is not a mere thus-saith-the-Lord that
you are trying to shirk. It is an ethical principle that you
are bent on subverting -- a principle that won't spring one
hair-breadth for all the subterfuges of all the parsons in
Christendom."

I shuddered, yet daren't speak, for fear of making
matters worse. But with the good old Adamic instinct, I
blamed Rigby and Lushington alternately, the former for
his ill-timed censure of the cloth; the latter quite as justly,
for taking a mean advantage by maintaining his incognito,
and thus reserving an unsuspected second-barrel for 
emergencies.<pb n="170"/>

"Are you prepared to maintain that voluntary poverty is
necessary to salvation?" asked the clergyman, desperately
sounding for bottom in this uncharted sea of heresy.

"Necessary to salvation," repeated the General slowly.
"Necessary to salvation! Why cut prices here? Is it 
decorous? With whom are we chaffering? But what is salvation?
What, in the fiend's name, have we to do with any salvation
beyond the daily salvation from our own selfish 
propensities? 'Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save
his people from' -- from what? From hell? No such 
absurdity -- 'from their sins', all of which are, directly or indirectly,
traceable to selfishness. Moreover, 'he that seeketh to save
his soul shall lose it, and he that loseth his soul (or loseth
sight of his soul) for My sake the same shall find it.' It may
be very good Orthodoxy, but it's only middling 
Paganism, to hold that there is a certain temporal object -- namely,
competence -- to be acquired, and a certain alternate 
destination -- namely, heaven -- to be attained. Christianity, differing
widely from Orthodoxy, and almost as widely as 
Paganism, merely points out a certain path to be followed, let
that path lead where it may. This is the way; walk ye in
it; the result in this life is a thing entirely outside your
province; the destiny of the vital spark is a thing altogether
beyond your apprehension. There is a sharp rebuke for
the men who aspire to sit, the one on Christ's right hand
and the other on His left in His Kingdom. Do you think<pb n="171"/>
the spiritual universe could gain anything by the saving of
a soul which (quoting Ben Jonson) only serves the purpose
of salt, to prevent decay of the body? Be assured that
the man whose chief concern is the saving of his own
private soul is nothing better than a skunk. Nor can he,
with that object in view, develop into anything better
through time or eternity. I won't say because the stream
cannot rise higher than its source, for we're not discussing
hydrostatics, but because you can't get a clean thing out
of an unclean; because the Satan of spiritual selfishness can
never cast out the Satan of worldly selfishness; and this
exorcism, this expulsion of the selfish instinct, is the sole
object toward which religion ought to tend. Religion, to
make us better, must appeal to our higher instincts -- courage
and generosity. Orthodoxy appeals to our lowest -- fear and
selfishness; and its dishonesty appears in a subtle 
consecration of these rotten attributes. To be sure, it is also supposed
to appeal to our emotion of love, but of what value is the
love that can coexist with authorised fear and selfishness?
Let's see how it works out. But for the grace of God,
there goes John Bradford. Now, in the whole range of 
agnostic, deistical, or purely secular literature, can you point
out a sentiment as vile as that? Damn John Bradford. I tell
you, any man who clearly recognises the duty he owes to
God, and which can only be paid to society, has very little
time to concern himself over the salvation of his own 
contemptible soul, much less the feathering of his own equally
contemptible nest. Will any rational being, in full view of
up-to-date astronomical research, maintain this grain of
sand beneath our feet, this fly-speck on the scroll of Space,
to be the centre of the solar and sidereal universe? I think
not. Yet such a person would be logical and magnanimous
compared with one who, in the face of Christ's teaching,
deliberately cultivates paramount solicitude re the spiritual
microbe he calls his soul."

"Mr Rigby," exclaimed Lushington warmly.

"A  microbe  of  exceedingly  pestiferous  character,"
explained the Major, "but only when its owner makes it<pb n="172"/>
the centre of his system. When, on the other hand, he
relegates his own small individuality to its true place in the
plan of the universe -- and this implies more than Orthodoxy
has any idea of -- he becomes a god, co-operating with his
Creator in the only sublime work within our horizon -- to
wit, the elevation of humanity."

"Better elevate himself first," remarked Thompson, with
a hopeless sigh.

"Good and trite," snapped Rigby, in whose eyes the
seasoned bullock driver had never outgrown or supplanted
Thompson's boy, Steve. "The real self-elevation is 
presupposed; it has been effected by the abnegation of all
measly personal interests, secular and spiritual. But I'm
afraid that, in your mind, the word 'elevation' is associated
with the feat of making a rise. In your bright lexicon,
'elevation' and 'swell' are cognate terms. Possibly, however,
your Maker's idea of degradation somewhat resembles
your notion of dignity and *vice versa*. Steve, I have known
and respected your father for five-and-twenty years. Will
you promise to carefully read the *Encheiridion* of Epictetus
if I give you the book tomorrow?"

"No, I'll swear I won't!" replied Thompson in quick
alarm. "The name's quite enough for me. I can find enough
worry in knocking out a living, without any help from
that class of people. Bad thing to know too much. Seems
to me that the true secret of life -- if a fellow could always
bear it in mind -- is to be found in one of Mungo Park's
adventures. He was exploring in Africa at the time; and
somehow, through a string of misfortunes, he found himself
so badly left that there seemed nothing for it but to give
the whole thing best, and make up his mind to peg out.
But just then he happened to notice a bit of moss --"

"Ah, do tell us that yarn, Steve," I murmured.

"Have a little patience, then. This moss set him 
thinking, and he said to himself, 'Now, the Lord watches
over that miserable, insignificant, useless, little excuse for
a plant; and, if so, it's a moral certainty that He watches<pb n="173"/>
over me.' So he tackled the track again, and came out with
nothing to complain of."

"Are you willing to accept the lesson that your moss
really teaches, Steve?" asked the Major gravely. "That
moss fulfilled the little purpose of its little life. It 
transformed a small portion of crude mineral matter into 
vegetable mould; it absorbed a certain quantity of carbonic acid
gas from the atmosphere, and replaced it by oxygen,
thereby making this earth more fertile and wholesome.
That moss accomplished its vocation. You stand on a 
somewhat higher plane of responsibility. Will you bequeath to
society a little vegetable mould in the shape of protest
against injustice? Will you, to the best of your despicable
ability, endeavour to establish equilibrium in the elements
of the social-economic atmosphere? Only on such terms
are you justified in comparing yourself with that bit of
moss."

"Well, Mr Rigby, we must at least give you credit for a
frank avowal of the Socialistic principle of levelling 
downward," remarked the tenacious Lushington. "But is it not
absolutely necessary to our advancement that society should
be graded? I admit that the property qualification is not the
highest that could be devised; still, it gives scope to the
praiseworthy ambition of anyone who aspires to be an
almoner of his Divine Master. We can turn the existing
classification of society to good account, but only by 
glorifying God in our lives. Rich and poor have their respective
duties. Our Creator has allotted to each man a separate
sphere in life; and within the limits of that sphere, our
individual duty is to obey Christ's Golden Rule -- 
'Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so
to them.' "

"Semi-colon," sighed the Judge. "Finish the sentence,
Mr Lushington."

"'For this is the Law and the Prophets,'" added the
clergyman, good-naturedly.

"All honor to the lawgivers and the prophets -- 
Mongolian, Hindoo, Iranian, Hebrew, Arabian, and anonymous
 -- for such an injunction," conceded the Major. "Observe
that, in your quotation, the sentiment is frankly and
honestly accredited to the prophets of an earlier 
dispensation. Now, any religion which fails to make this Golden
Rule obsolete is not Christianity -- as we shall see presently.<pb n="175"/>
Meantime, let us deal with the purely secular side of the
question. Christianity, on its first point of contact with
economics, inaugurates a perfect Socialistic system. 
Inevitably so, since it speaks the last word in all that concerns
men's welfare. Listen, now, and correct me if I misquote
or suppress: And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto
you, there is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or
sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or
lands, for my sake and the Gospel's, but he shall receive an
hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren,
and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with
persecutions; and in the world to come, eternal life.' Is
that a forecast of Socialism -- or is it not? I tell you, boys,
Orthodoxy is doing its best to make Christ a false prophet."

"The quotation is correct at all events," remarked
Furlong, gravely, "Mark x, 29 and 30. Parallel passage
in Matthew xix, 29. But I always thought it referred to the
disciples."

"So it does," replied the Colonel, drily. "We are the
disciples -- pseudo-disciples -- but let that pass. Christianity
proper has an epoch only, followed by an age-long present
tense. It is our human progress, or decadence, that is marked
by eras. But when Christ abolished class-servitude in all its
degrees --"

"Pardon me," interposed the clergyman, with some
eagerness, "Christ did not even prohibit slavery. He 
enjoined love to all men, bond and free. The abolition of
slavery is a work of modern civilisation, not of primitive
Christianity. Paul, you will remember, sent the absconder,
Onesimus, back to his master, Philemon."

"Poor, zealous, devoted, purblind Paul," commented
the Deacon. "He couldn't see that Christ abolished every
form of obligatory servitude, in His own emphatic and
unanswerable way, when He washed His disciples' feet -- 
the special task of a slave -- and impressed upon them that
they, or their successors, or we, or our successors, should
thereafter grasp the significance of His action. I don't
blame the Apostles for their obtuseness, but if we don't<pb n="176"/>
know more of the mind of Christ than they did -- Paul
included -- the collection-plate has been passed round to
very little purpose indeed. The religion of Christ being 
expressed in principles, not in hard-and-fast ordinances, lends
itself to unlimited expansion, covering any and every
degree of civilization, yet remaining a unit in purpose and
effect. For instance, not one of the eighteen or twenty
parables relating to the Kingdom of God has become
antiquated by the march of thought or the advance of
modern science. You must look for finality in mathematics,
not in Christianity -- which is Socialism. Though, in the
nature of things," continued the Sheriff, magnanimously,
"the Socialist, however sincere, must fall ludicrously short
of the Christian standard."

"It suits you just now to barrack for the Bible," remarked
Thompson. "Well, the Bible commands us to do our duty
in that state of life into which it has pleased God to call
us."

"I won't ask you to place your finger on the passage,
Steve," replied the Colonel with real generosity. "Let us 
examine the precept on its own merits. What of those hands
that the rod of empire might have swayed, or waked to
ecstasy the living lyre? Ah, the poet found them 
penury-repressed, condemned to ignorance, obscurity, and relative
uselessness. What of the boy, or girl, inherently gifted with
special talents of the highest importance to art or science,
yet born into the rank and file of unskilled manual labour?
What of the man or woman of limited intellect, 
overflowing energy, and fine physique, born to wealth, and with no
aspiration or potency beyond fashion and amusement?
No need to quote actual cases, for each one of us is familiar
with this obvious kink in the order of things. But to any
mind not hopelessly servile, the question at once presents
itself: Has God been pleased to call these, respectively, into
the state of life in which we find them? If so, why thus
blindly frustrate His own manifest design, cancelling<pb n="177"/>
inborn endowment by erratic assignment? The way out of
the difficulty is simply to justify God's legislation by
relevant and faithful administration. Which, I may add,
is the sole aim of Socialism."

"But someone must do the thankless work," objected
Binney.

"Why should any work be thankless?" asked the Major.
"Let some equitable and rational system be substituted for
the present factitious destiny which jams the round man
into the square hole, and no occupation will be thankless
or ignoble. All such distinctions are in reality artificial
and unsound. Quote me a civilisation or a society where
the soldier, or the artificer, or the cultivator, or what not, is
held in highest esteem, and I will match your example with
another, showing where the gradation is reversed, and your
Hyperion becomes a satyr. Now, if you can formulate, or
even suggest, any scheme, apart from Socialism, which
promises anything like intelligent order in place of this
rotten chaos, I, for one, will gladly fall in with that project.
Or prove that Socialism, by seconding and reinforcing the
special abilities of each individual, will condemn any
worthy person to degrading work, and I reject the system
as an imposture."

"But I cannot see how you identify Christianity with
Socialism, or even compare them," persisted Lushington.
"Apart from the distinction of perfection and unsoundness,
Christianity is spiritual, while Socialism is secular. One is a
religion; the other is a polity.

"Very good definitions," replied the Judge, with 
portentous complaisance. "Now let us inquire into the 
relationship of religion and polity -- first making sure of our
definitions. Polity is a clean-cut, unambiguous term, 
however wide the ground it may cover; but religion --"

Here our controversial toper paused a moment, 
preparing to enjoy the full flavor of this long-sleever, thus happily
cast in his way.
<pb n="178"/>

"We're booked for it now," muttered Thompson, aside
to me.

"Nothing to signify," I replied, in the same tone. "He's
off-colour, tonight, partly paralysed for want of
opposition, and partly crippled by the necessity of running
on Bible lines, in deference to you fellows."

"Religion, divested of frill, formalism, and fable, is merely
the science of conduct," continued the Senator. "Yet 
religion is not ethics, remember, any more than a running
locomotive is a permanent way. Ethics is a moral science
(I shall endeavour to prove it an exact science), whilst
religion is an applied science, applied, namely, to conduct.
And any belief in revelation, any belief in the 
supernatural, if it fails to control conduct, is of no more moment
than a belief in the bunyip. Such a belief may be sublime
or squalid, poetical or gross; still its religious pretensions
are measured by its motive power alone, not by its aesthetic
qualities, except insofar as these affect conduct. But a
belief which leads up to unselfishness, to championship of
the lowly and challenge of the overweening, to the 
living of a clean and useful life; or one which, on the other
hand, leads down to servility, tyranny, or condescension,
to the apotheosis of thrift, or to the toleration of any
manifest evil -- such a belief, I say, rises to the dignity of a
religion, inasmuch as it controls conduct. Are you following
me, boys?"

"In our own feeble way, Colonel."

"Before we enter upon the relationship of religion to

distorted ethics. In the first place, we are brought in touch

moral perception -- a faculty far more subject to aberration
than any other super-physical sense, such as the 
apprehension of the beautiful, the sublime, the pathetic, or what not.
And the reflex action of this unreliable moral perception is
conscientiousness. Conscience derives its initiative from
moral perception alone; and moral perception, when 
blurred by ignorance, or paralysed by servility, or tempted by
advantage, becomes about equal in trustworthiness to what
Dixon would call the *ignis* (adj.) *fatuus*. Hence the 
perversion of moral perception entails a corresponding 
debauchment of conscience. Am I making myself clear?"

"No," I replied.

"To resume, then. An involuntary, and often annoying,
act of the mind -- to the operation of which act every man,
woman, or parson is subject -- affixes one of two moral
attributes to any given thought or action. These two
abstractions, antithetical by necessity, are rightness and
wrongness; and any special moral quality, such as heroism
or meanness, altruism or selfishness, adherent to any thought
or action, naturally falls under the heading of this or that
primary abstraction. And in our endeavour to draw a
definite, practicable, and satisfactory frontier-line between
the right and the wrong is found one of the few points in
which we shine superior to the pig. We have been defined
as a religious animal; and when it is clearly understood that
religion is not an end in itself, but a means toward an
end -- that end being the prescription and authentication of
a positive line of morality -- the title of 'religious animal'
will appear good enough for the like of us.

"But history -- ancient, modern, and contemporary -- 
copiously proves, by the testimony of results, that the lines
dogmatically laid down by exponents of this, that, or the
other religion, have been merely empirical ones, drawn by
rule of thumb, to suit the interests or prejudices of some
dominant order. Therefore it was long ago remarked, with
better philosophy than grammar, that 'there is a way that
seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the
ways of death.' Yet there must somewhere be a definite<pb n="181"/>
line separating the positive right from this right-seeming
wrong, and conversely, the positive wrong from any 
wrong-seeming right. There must be a zero-line, where the two
absolute abstractions meet; but to save trouble, let it be
for the moment conceded that this line may cover 
multitudinous thoughts and actions, not of doubtful, but of neutral,
appraisement.

"At the same time we must insist on an unvarying
polarity of the abstractions. Moral expediency, offering
itself to compromise and subterfuge, is below the plane on
which this question moves. Moral expediency has justified
every species of wrong hitherto invented, and condones
most species current at the present day. No principle that
we know of is so insidious, and, by inevitable sequence, so
pregnant with disaster as this. Good honest wrong, 
standing on its own demerits, and bearing its own label, is a
manly thing (in both senses), but, justified by expediency,
it becomes too mean to own any compact and expressive
designation. A head of red hair, calling itself red, compels
respect; whilst the same thatch, calling itself auburn,
becomes contemptible.

"Nor can the ignorance of our remotely or recently
harvested forefathers, however it may palliate their 
baseness and rascality, transform their wrong to right. These
abstractions lie embedded, fixed, in the structure of the
moral universe, independently of intellectual advance or
retrogression, and immovable by human opinion. Just as
white will be white, and black will be black, to the end
of time, so the right and wrong of a million years hence
will be precisely the right and wrong of today; unchanged
since yesterday, since last year, since last century; 
unchanged since the era of our cave-dwelling ancestors. And
the proof that those rude individuals devoted some portion
of their evil-smelling leisure to an honest analysis of these
abstractions is found in the fact that our own moral 
horizon is more extensive and clearer than theirs. If, for instance,
they had been as oblivious to the public good as Steve
and Tom here, they would have thereby surrendered the<pb n="182"/>
one link connecting them -- not with the anthropoid ape, but
with the over-soul. So with ourselves, and so with our
successors, till the last man gratuitously defies the 
inoffensive sun in grave and graceful iambic verse. If polygamy,
treachery, avarice, robbery, and murder be wrong in the
world today, these were equally wrong in Bible times.
Who were the patriarchs, law-givers, and psalmists that
their complacent ignorance should play fast and loose
with the central principle of civilisation? Further, if usury,
monopoly, capitalism, profit-mongering, and so forth were
wrong on the Galilean Mount in the time of Tiberias, these
are wrong in Australia today. Who are you that an
absolutely immovable principle should bend to your present
or prospective interests? If, on the other hand, usury,
monopoly, and similar customs, were right in new 
Testament times, they are right today, and will be none the less
right when a more enlightened age shall sternly prohibit
such workings of the spirit. This theory of absolute 
morality may seem severe, but there is no other rule. Moral
expediency is not an alternative rule; it is merely an evasion
of the rule. Any dissent from this postulate, boys?"

Hardly likely. No one hankered to catch hold of a live
wire carrying a current of something like one thousand
volts.

"What we desperately need," resumed the Major, "is a
canon of morality which will authoritatively, and above
all, reliably, mark a positive line for our guidance. Let us
see and recognize the 0 meridian on our moral chart, in
order that we may reckon the east or west longitude of
each thought or action from that base, and, at our own
peril, steer accordingly. Lacking a moral border-line,
accurate in itself, and unambiguous, we have unavoidable
misunderstanding, continual friction, and frequent
collision.

"Pity that ignorance, fanaticism, and chiefly 
compromise, have so soiled the word 'religion' that its very sound
is apt to repel honest minds, for as religion is the bridge<pb n="183"/>
between ethics and conduct, we must find our zero-line
here or nowhere.

"Amongst dead and moribund religions, the stoic
philosophy probably came nearest to the discovery of a
positive line of morality. Supremely noble in all its aspects,
stoicism must have touched the line at many points; but for
need of the transitive element -- namely, sympathy -- this 
religion flickered out, whilst baser doctrines containing that
element have survived. Worldliness, bear in mind, has two
antitheses, widely diverse from each other; one of these is
introverted self-sacrifice, the other is out-flowing 
benevolence. Stoicism, teaching the first, aimed at redemption of
the individual; Christianity, inculcating the second, aimed
at elevation of the race.

"At the present time, fabulous millions of more or less
rational beings theoretically accept as positive a line 
indicated by One whom every impartial and intelligent man -- 
believer, agnostic, deist, or what not -- ranks as the 
Non-pareil of humanity. This Faithful Witness drew no arbitrary
or experimental line, remember. Governed absolutely by
the eternal abstractions, the purpose of His life was to
annotate a line coeval and coexistent with reason. And the
relation of our countless horde of religious animals to that
section of the moral line which passes through the 
important province of social-economics is the question before
this synod. I insist that, whereas the line itself is straight,
your perversion of it comes me cranking into the domain
of Wrong, subverting all symmetry, and originating a
monstrous cantle of debatable area; all this occurring at
the very point where honest judgment should maintain -- 
and stoic magnanimity *did* maintain -- strictest fidelity. This
deviation of yours has been on trial since history began,
entailing insupportable disquietude and hardship, which
you gloze as best you may, determined to gather grapes of
thorns, and refusing all lessons taught by the chastisement
of the spines. In the meantime, my sympathy is with the
spines."<pb n="184"/>

## CHAPTER XXXV



- O, it is strange,
- 'Tis passing strange, to mark his fallacies.
- {:.indent-6}Henry Kirke White.
{:.poetry}

"And do you imagine that your system would increase the
sum of human happiness?" I asked.

"Certainly not," replied the General.

"The moral constitution of man debars such interference.
We disclaim the miraculous. Happiness is not an ingredient
of life, subject to the augmentation or diminution by 
prescription. It is the outcome, or rather the fruition, of an
inherent susceptibility, which latter is governed in tone,
though not affected in extent, by the conditions which
form individual character. You, for instance, may enjoy
the spectacle of a twenty-round contest for the 
championship of middle-weights as much as a man of different taste
would enjoy an intelligent contemplation of the celestial
bodies through a first-class equatorial. You and the other
person are alike in capacity for happiness, as well as in
proclivity to science, but your inclinations are dissimilar.
Or you may enjoy capering along in the off-side lead of
your landlord's carriage as much as any apostle of the new
order enjoys the consciousness of rolling his old chariot
along. In each of these suppositions the happiness may be
quantitatively equal, though a moment's thought will show
it to be qualitatively diverse. Happiness, taken as an element,
is merely one of the necessary factors of existence. In our
unconscious appraisement of life, the balance of happiness
over misery is precisely that goodweight which turns the
scale in favour of survival, as against extinction. Man can
no more exist without drawing his dole of so-called<pb n="185"/>
happiness than without breathing so many cubic feet of oxygen
per annum. Observe how the persistent tendency to 
equilibrium in joy and sadness guarantees a comic song and a
merry dance as Nature's rejoinder to negro slavery or
Irish despoilment. But this spontaneous pendulum-swing
marks the limit of Nature's domain. It rests with man to
build a more or less worthy moral structure on the elastic
foundation which she may be trusted to supply. So that the
real question, a side issue at best, is whether Socialism will
raise the moral plane of such capacities for enjoyment as
have been implanted in our two-fold nature. Our two-fold
nature, remember; for the baser potencies, judiciously
humored, will give as large face-value in dividends of
happiness as the higher element can impart. Leave that to
Nature, though one of her rules is to respond to greed of
happiness with a relevant form of indigestion. This is where
she has had the drop on many a Solomon beside the King
of Israel. But tell me, did a pure altruism, such as Socialism
authorises and ordains, ever work out the quotient of
vanity and vexation of spirit? And this reminds me that
the author of Ecclesiastes, rather late in the day, noted the
tears of such as were oppressed; on the side of whose
oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.
'Wherefore,' he continues (and I want you to mark the
adverb, boys), 'I praise the dead which are already dead
more than the living which are yet alive. Yea, better is he
than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not
seen the evil work that is done under the sun.' Now, 
anything that is done is subject to prevention or revision. This
is exactly what Socialism aims at, and what Individualism
strenuously labors to prevent. The opposition (I am willing
to believe) arises more often from a warped 
conscientiousness than from a deliberate perversity. This is strikingly
manifest among professing Christians, particularly in the
various branches of the Wesleyan cult, where the pathetic
effort to serve God and Mammon is reduced to a system,
fortified by the accumulated sanction of millions of holy
and money-making men -- men who, by Divine grace, are<pb n="186"/>
purified from every unprofitable sin. Compulsory poverty,
with its endless train of evils, they hold to be a Divine
institution -- which it is each man's duty to oppose tooth
and nail on his own private account. And they feel that
they are right, which is a fine sensation. But there is such
a penalty as the strong delusion, that we should believe a
lie, knowing it to be a lie; and it is this quasi-honest
obliquity of moral vision which makes it so hard for those
who have riches -- in possession or in prospect, in actuality
or in imagination -- to see their way into that 
master-province of the Kingdom of God which we call Socialism.
Becky Sharp's notion -- so prevalent in the world -- that it is
easy to be good on £5000 a year, argues a moral imbecility
not worth criticism, and betrays a disgraceful ignorance of
man's highest conclusions respecting his relation to Nature.
In reality, the only harder task is to be good on a larger
income."

"What is your idea of goodness?" asked the foolhardy
clergyman.

"Stripped of misleading subtleties," replied the Colonel,
"goodness is anything that intuitively or of set purpose
makes for the establishment of a human relationship which
will develop each man's best, and starve each man's worst;
making us an honor, rather than a reproach, to the
mysterious Power which has fashioned us with 
potentialities yet unfathomed. From this supreme utility, and from
this alone, do the Absolute Abstractions derive their
distinctive qualities. Art, Science, Industry, Commerce -- 
these are corollaries, not unities; media, not ultimates;
forces, not results; their end and purpose being something
that will throw Bentham's 'greatest good to the greatest
number' into an aspect of infamous injustice toward a 
helpless minority. Now, you won't deny the easy possibility of
such social-economic abuse as would fully qualify every
hundredth man for the bottomless pit. Aggravate the abuse,
and you force into perdition every tenth man. Another
turn of the screw, and every second man is gone. A little<pb n="187"/>
more, and not even angel-scrutiny shall discover the moral
equal of Lot (which is saying very little indeed.)
Humanity's susceptibility to debasement is, at most, a
question of degree; the possible pressure is unlimited; and
there are bounds to the fidelity of each individual. 
Conversely, there is a conceivable social system -- and, I believe,
an attainable one -- which would spontaneously and surely
crystallise into actuality the highest race-destiny ever
pictured by imagination. These two vagaries, Mr 
Lushington, represent, respectively, my idea of the nadir of
badness and the zenith of goodness. In the last resort even
dogma ceases to be authoritative, and the quality of any
line of action is measured by its anticipated outcome -- 
carefully guarding against moral expediency."

"Well," remarked Dixon, who had listened to the
Deacon's exposition without a trace of the discomfort
produced by Furlong's loftier rendering -- "well, I ain't a
religious man myself, even if I do look forrid to bein' one;
but you, my word, you ought to be a minister o' the (adj.)
gospel."

"So I am -- bar the adjective -- which, by the way, is only
too appropriate."

"Not a proper sin-shifter," objected Dixon. "You can't
chris'n a kid, nor yet say the (adj.) words over people."

"No, Dixon, I don't live on the game."

This was too much. "I should have mentioned to you,
Senator," said I, "that Mr Lushington is a clergyman -- 
a fisher of men, as well as of thirty-pounders."

"Then I owe you an apology, Mr Lushington," 
responded the Major, gravely; "and I tender it with more
humility than I can put into words. I have a very bad habit
of speaking unadvisedly, and, of course, often unjustly, and
my penalty is self-reproach, such as I feel now. I beg your
pardon, Mr Lushington, most sincerely."

"Not another word on the subject, if you please," replied
the fisherman genially. "If we meet again -- as I trust we
shall -- it may transpire that our differences of opinion are<pb n="188"/>
in no way vital. For the present, I may say that you have
inspired me with something like envy for your abilities."

The Commodore made a befitting guileful reply, and
a half-minute's silence was broken by the harsh dissonant
voice of the kangaroo hunter, who was sitting farther up
the river, a little apart from the rest.

"All very fine for you blokes to go fetchin' out your
argyments about right an' wrong, an' all the rest of it,"
broke in the young fellow, with a subjective petulance
which seemed to size up his Ego. "But what do you think
of a man workin' for a slant to do a thing that's bound to
send him to hell straight? Well, that's me. I'll tell you how
I come to be in this predicament; and it'll give you some
idear how much good your Socialism is when it comes to
a case of oc'lar demonster."

"To the point -- who is she?" murmured the Colonel 
impatiently, but in a voice audible only to his immediate 
neighbors. By this time, of course, he regarded the audience as
his own private diggings, by right of valid pre-emption,
and rigid fulfilment of labor covenant.

"It's all through a girl, an' she was worth it, no matter
how people might cock up their nose at her, if they knew.
I'll tell you the whole yarn."

"And you'll be sorry for it in the morning, if I judge
you correctly," continued the superseded Major, in his
former tone.

"I'm a well-brought-up man, though I say it myself,"
pursued the conversational interloper. "You don't hear no
(verb) this, nor (adj.) that, out o' *my* mouth. My ole man,
he's got a slashin' farm not eighty miles from where we're
sittin' -- no occasion for sayin' which road. Well, there was
a girl come into our district, three years ago, an' me an'<pb n="190"/>
her struck up together, an' we was as right as rain for over
twelve months, an' nobody would a dreamed anythin' could
come between us. But behold you, there comes a new bobby
to the township -- a feller that was living separated from
his wife -- an' before you could say 'knife' all the girls in the
district was gone on the blasted hound. He was an ole bloke,
too -- forty, if he was a day, -- but I notice these ole married
divils is always the worst. He was jist about the ugliest
cur I ever *did* see, with a baird right up to his eyes, but
the girls they used to be always blathering about what a
splendid-lookin' man he was. It didn't trouble me; but I
hated him from the first day I seen him, an' that cove was
the instigation o' me bein' here tonight. I s'pose it was to
be.

"Well, he'd got the place to himself, an' a feller by the
name o' the 'Old Skipper' cookin' for him, an' today you"d
see him grinnin' at a bar-maid; an' tomorrow you'd meet
him in the bush with a girl on horseback; an' next day you'd
see another girl yarnin' with him across a fence; an' all the
girls in the district blazin' with jealousy about the lousy
cur -- an' him a married man. Well, it so happened, Nora
had to come a good deal in his road, an' she was the nicest
girl in the district; an' oh he was this, an' that, an' the
other thing, an' your humble servant, an' a polished 
scoundrel at the back of it all. But she took no more notice of
him at first nor if he was the dog.

"But it come round one night that there was a big meetin'
about Home Rule; an' she was there along o' the other
girl that worked partners with her; an' I was there with
some blokes I knew; an' somehow or another a row started
between some Orangemen and some Gruffs; an' I 
happened to be in the thick of it; an' up comes my lord, an'
grabs me by the collar; an' me nothin' to do with the
row, but dragged into it, as you might say, through backin'
up one o' the Gruffs that was a friend of mine. Course, I
makes a welt at the copper -- for I won't stand to be scruffed
by any living man if I can git at him fair -- but he gits a
twist on me, an' he goes out of his way to run me nearly<pb n="191"/>
over the top o' Nora; an' he stops a minute to apologize,
shakin' me now an' again like a dog with a possum, an' me
helpless on account o' the holt he had; an' then he
runs me out an' shoves me in chokey, an' back he goes to
the meetin'. Course, I was bailed out that night, an' when
Court day come I got clear with only a caution for makin'
the hit at the blasted varmin.

"Well, to my surprise, instead o' Nora swearin' off at
him and spittin' in his face if he spoke to her, she seemed
sort o' taken with him, and naturally this grew into what
you might call a coolness between me an' her. Well,
upon me word, I tried to buck up to another girl, purpose
to vex Nora, but I couldn't stummick it no road. Though,
mind you, I'll say this for myself," he continued, with a
flash of that unaccountable and most reprehensible bravado
which appears to be confined to the nobler sex, "I was none
o' your greenhorns that butter wouldn't melt in their mouth,
an' frightened if a girl spoke to them. No innocence about
me, I promise you. I was edicated up to the knocker before
ever I seen Nora.

"Course I'd got a set on the copper, but I had to sing
small; an' after a while I noticed Nora was clean broke off
with him, an' they passed one another without a word; an'
the copper he sort o' dodged me; an' presently I got thick
with Nora again. But she wasn't the same girl she used to be;
all her jolliness was gone. Well, it seems the copper's wife
had somebody watchin' him, and suddenly there was a
flare-up, an' he had to resign, or git the run; so he resigned
an' went up the country horsebreaking; for I'll say this
much to his credit, that he was about as good a hand among
rough horses as you'd git. Give the divil his due.

"Well, things dragged on for a couple or three months,
an' me an' Nora was as friendly as ever; but there was
somethin' about her I couldn't make out, no road. At last
one night I was seein' her home from a bazaar; an' it was
as dark as pitch; an' suddenly she says.

"'Come an' sit on this log,' says she. 'I got to tell you
somethin'; I can't bear this state of things one minit longer.'<pb n="192"/>


"So she started an' has a bit of a cry, an' then she tells
me what was on her mind. Seems she wanted to go one
Sunday to see another dressmaker she knew in a township
about twelve mile away; an' *him*, he gammoned he wanted
to go the same road on some business, so what does he do
but he gits a buggy and away goes the two o' them -- her
kickin' herself all the time for lettin' things go so fur -- an'
comin' back he made out he wanted to go the other track
through the bush."

The narrator checked himself, then went on with an
infirm attempt at nonchalance.

"Well, now, I seen them drivin' home that same evenin';
and I don't deny I was narked a bit extry; but I had no
more suspicion nor. . . ." Again he paused; when he resumed
there was subdued and seething fury in every reluctant
syllable. "Well, he was a big strong lump of a man, and
she was a weed of a woman, so to speak -- an' -- an' -- never
mind." The last two words were shattered by a sardonic
laugh; then he continued, "It's all very well to talk, but
what could she do without makin' the thing worse -- 
advertisin' herself, as you might say? An' there was *him*
stalkin' about the township as bold as brass for months
after, lookin' over my head whenever we met one another;
an' me knowin' no more about what had took place nor
the man in the moon. Oh, never mind, it's all right -- or,
at least, it'll be all right yet."

"The scoundrel!" exclaimed Lushington. "Hanging
would be too good for him."

"Well, I got his wages in my cartridge belt," replied
the other grimly. "I'm on his track this time safe, even if I
had to kill time for a fortnit - or else I wouldn't be in this
quarter tonight. Course, I mightn't git him for another
month, but he's booked to go. The laugh'll be on my side
then. Puttin' in a spoke for poor ole Nora, too -- knockin'
over two birds with one stone, as the sayin' is. Present time
I got the patience o' Job. I left a good home three months
ago o' purpose to learn *him* what a fool he was to think I
was safe for him to blow his nose on. I got a fair idear<pb n="193"/>
where to lay wait for him this time, and he's a gift to me
when I get him in range. Now I've said it."

"But, my dear friend," said the clergyman, gravely,
"though I sympathise deeply with you, I must condemn
your purpose of taking the law into your own hands.
'Vengeance is mine: I will repay,' saith the Lord."

"Didn't you say this bloke wanted hangin'?" retorted the
other. "Is the Lord goin' to hang him? Does the Lord hang
a feller for makin' a Aunt Sally of another feller, an'
laughin' in his sleeve all the time?"

"Apart from the stings of conscience, and the retribution
of the world to come, God punishes by the agency of our
Criminal Law."

"Hold on, then; you stick to that," eagerly replied the
young fellow, apparently just waking up to his own 
imprudence in telling the story, and thereby stung to fresh
irascibility. "Sposen there's a man in a place called Sussex,
in England, an' this man shakes a bushel o' wheat for his
missis to boil for the kids to keep 'em from starvin' -- does
God give that man seven years' laggin', and then set him
adrift, with his ankles wore to the bone with the irons, and
his shoulders like a soojee bag with floggin'? Well, that was
my gran'father -- an' as decent a man as ever your 
gran'father knowed how to be. Is that God's style o' punishin'
people with the Criminal Law? Don't talk rubbage."

"I admit that, where offences against property were 
concerned, the law was exceedingly severe in the days of our
forefathers; indeed, it is, perhaps, too severe still in some
instances, but --"

"But God backs it up. Stick to your argyment. We'll see
if it's too severe. Sposen a lawyer gets six hundred notes
of a cockie's money into his claws, an' then hums and ha's
and can't be made to fork it over -- does God on'y jist put a
set on that lawyer, so's he's got to go partners with another
lawyer for a couple o' years? Well, that was what 
happened to my ole man, when I was twelve or fourteen, an'
it nearly sent us on the wallaby. Don't talk to me about<pb n="194"/>
law. If it was middlin' decent, a cove might spring a bit to
suit it; but it ain't even middlin'; it's the rottenest, 
disgrace-fullest, G--d-d--dest thing from here to hell."

"I admit that it is an unsafe thing to meddle with; but
you must consider --"

"Look here, you'll make me disagreeable an' nasty, the
way you're goin' on. How the hell-fire can the law be a
unsafe thing to meddle with, if God's got any say in it?
Ain't the law a (adj.) sight unfairer every way nor the
cronkest gamblin'? An' people ain't sich mullock-brained,
flamin' ijiots as to say God bosses that. Mind you, I believe
in God; but He's jist got as much to do with law as He's
got to do with -- God eternally d--n me for a (adj.) fool."

As this amiable young person barked out the last words,
he rose and withdrew fifteen or twenty yards farther along
the bank, where he mechanically threw his line into the
river, and sat down. Lushington followed, and found a
seat beside him. Then ensued the low, earnest tones of the
clergyman's voice, and the short, sullen replies of the other,
equally unintelligible to the rest of us.

By this time the so-called kangaroo hunter and Furlong
were the only ones of our party who continued to keep up
the procedure of fishing-the former from restlessness, the
latter still under the glamour of the thirty-pounder. The
sport had hitherto consisted partly in getting our hooks
caught on submerged roots, and partly in having our baits
eaten off by the large, prickly crayfish which are always
plentiful, except when you are equipped for catching them.
But the slope of the bank was such a comfortable angle
to recline against, the night was so pleasant, and the seventy
or eighty yards of slow-swirling water so beautiful in the
light of an unobtrusive half-moon, that we felt right
enough as we were. Moreover, neither Binney nor 
Lushington could read midnight in the position of the stars, and
the rest of us were not addicted to regular hours.

"Well, our discussion has, at least, effected the 
ambiguous  service  of  saving  an  infamous  ex-bobby's  life,"<pb n="195"/>
remarked the irrepressible Colonel, addressing his 
contracted audience.

"Guesswork and prophecy are two different things,"
retorted Thompson, sourly pedantic.

"Not altogether, Steve. Prophecy is guesswork, made 
unerring by accurate foresight, and the foresight here 
required demands only a scientific knowledge of overgrown
waywardness. If this young fellow had, in the first place,
confided his grievance to a friend or two, he would never
have gone on the war-path, even though he had been
advised to do so. A mere narration of the affront would
have broken that personal equation which has governed
his intentions till tonight. 'Affront,' I say advisedly, for
observe how frankly our friend poses as champion of his
own damaged dignity, rather than of the poor girl's 
outraged chastity. A lesson in human nature, Steve. A mirror
where each of us may see himself at his worst, free from
the mask of cant. Hence I honor the young fellow's lack
of magnanimity, inasmuch as it implies an equal lack of
self-delusion or hypocrisy."

"All's well that ends well," remarked Binney, evidently
relieved by the Major's prediction.

"Ah, but there's no end to anything," replied that prophet
insidiously. "Eternal mutation is nature's law -- compulsory
as to movement, though dirigible as to tendency; and it
rests with us, as the beings most affected by such."

"Think he'll marry Nora?" speculated Thompson,
absently.

"Could anything be less desirable for either party?"
asked the Doctor. "No, Steve, she has cost him too much.
Let me explain. Man, in a not unpraiseworthy diversion of
selfishness, instinctively over-values the woman who brings
out his best; and correspondingly under-estimates her who
brings out his worst -- though each woman's influence may
operate unwittingly. In speaking of our friend's worst, I
am not referring to this gendarme-stalking enterprise, as
such, far from it, but to the spirit in which the task was
undertaken and followed up. Hit or miss, he would have<pb n="196"/>
been, and is, morally deformed from this time forward. In
point of fact, Nora's honor is an eminent consideration,
the sun and centre of a little universe, while our friend's
personal dignity is a small affair, an insignificant satellite
pertaining solely to his insignificant self. But, cramped by
a self-centred standard of honor, he began by allowing
this moon to eclipse that sun; and now he will stultify 
himself by ignoring both. A strain of Irish-Catholic in his 
incorrigible Anglicanism would have helped his Australian
sensitiveness to a truer sense of proportion, to a nicer point
of honor, and a higher perception of justice. And it is the
lack of this nobler incentive -- felt, though not formulated --
which will paralyse his vindictive purpose, and send him
home an apostate from revengefulness, yet not a convert to
anything better. However, such a capacity for 
single-hearted resentment commands respect, even though it be
so poorly backed by moral discrimination. Sir, I like a good
hater."

"Stolen," rejoined Thompson maliciously.

"I forget at the present moment where the expression is
from. Do you know, Tom?"

"No," I replied in a still, small voice.

But the Deacon could find a text in anything -- or in 
nothing, for that matter -- and there was a Satanic charm in his
voice as he now dishonestly transferred our attention from
the particular to the general.

"You're perfectly right," he remarked affably (though
no one had spoken on the subject). "That splintering of
lances on the abstract merits of our collective branches of
jurisprudence, loosely designated 'law', is very suggestive.
Very suggestive indeed. Our friend goes only half-way,
landing, of course, in anarchism. Still, within that limit, he
is right, from a moral, though not from a grammatical
point of view. The inception of law is, I take it, a stronger
evidence of our superior nature than any based on the
existence of artistic or scientific potentiality. Why then,
Steve, do we hate, and fear, and loathe, this product of
our own highest faculties?

"I'm sure I don't know -- and, what's more, I don't care,"
muttered Thompson, while he hastily rose, and, making
his way along the bank, took up a fresh position, placing
me between the Colonel and himself.

"The reason is," continued Rigby, turning now to
Binney, "that such law -- civil and criminal -- as we have
experience of, is originally founded, not on equity, but
on privilege, and the scent of the privilege clings round
it still. Therefore it is through the instrumentality of<pb n="198"/>
law that the abject ignorance and *panem-et-circenses*
selfishness of --"

"Good (adj.) shot," growled Dixon, approvingly.

"-- of our dilatory ancestors has been visited upon their
descendants, in the shape of a long-drawn hell of 
oppression in the past, and, unfortunately, we've by no means
done with the penalty yet. Our ancestors sought the moral
ague of degradation -- sought it carefully, with tears --
leaving us to locate and diagnose the hereditary malady,
and afterward evolve an Abracadabra for its exorcism --"

"What the --" interrupted Dixon, and as quickly checked
himself, while the Major rolled on --

"-- part of our punishment for their sins is the congenital
strabismus which leads us to see in the title 'law-abiding',
a compliment, rather than an insult."

"Taking the term in its accepted sense, it is a 
compliment," replied Binney, deliberately; and as he spoke I could
hear the rapidly-receding flap-flap of his guardian angel's
wings. "I see your drift, Mr Rigby; but you mustn't force
the meaning of the word. Unpunishable evasion may 
indicate a defect in the law, I'll allow, but that's a very different
thing from unjust purpose. The law, in its intention, is a
terror unto evil-doers and a praise unto them that do
well."

"Why, then," asked the Sheriff, "is it easier, as well as
safer, for any decently educated man to rob by permission
of the law than in defiance of it? Take away that part of
man's inhumanity to man which is perpetrated under 
protection and sanction of the law, and how much is left to
complain of? Is the law a terror, or is it a safeguard to the
land-shark, or the usurer, to the extortioner, the sweater or
the rack-renter? Isn't it a terror to the man whose chimney
catches fire, rather than to the other man who, by strictly
legal exaction, drives a better citizen than himself to suicide?
And as for being a praise unto them that do well, how do
you account for the fact that the pages of history are sown
broadcast with the names of martyred apostles of 
progress, ninety-nine per cent of whom suffered by the<pb n="199"/>
operation of law? Our fathers killed these men -- killed them
legally, remember -- and we build their sepulchres, saying:
'If we had lived in the days of our fathers we would not
have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.'
Yet the only way in which we could have avoided that
guilt would have been by wiping our feet on the law."

"It's rather unfair to judge a broad principle by extreme
cases," objected Binney. "Generally speaking, men in all
ages have enjoyed the protection of the law, without any
corresponding hardship."

"True," conceded the Major; "and, in justice to 
humanity, I don't attribute their loyalty so much to lowness of
moral ideal as to lack of initiative. Some men, to be sure,
are worse than the laws they lived under, but most men
are much better. The latter may be divided into two classes
 -- first, those who let the hydra of legalised injustice sleep in
peace, these are the men you speak of; and second, those
who poke him up, and take the consequences -- these are the
men I speak of, the prophets whose sepulchres we build.
At the present time our monstrosity is drowsily 
recuperating, but he'll shortly be prodded into wakefulness, to make
a meal of such agitators as may be within reach. Let us
see on which side you and I may then be found. It's cheap,
for instance, to say that if we had been effective citizens of
Victoria in the fifties we would have recognised the
prophets and taken their part against the law, as represented
by Governor Hotham and his wire-pullers and satellites.
But if, in the coming rally, we appear as law-abiding men,
repudiating our contemporary agitators and all their works,
then in another generation, our children will build the
tombs of those agitators, saying: 'If we had lived in the
days of our fathers, we would not --'"

Here I lost a portion of the seditious utterance, for
Thompson earnestly whispered to me aside.

"He's fairly started at last, Tom -- sort of second wind. I
could see it gathering and backing up all the evening, and
when he gets that headway on, it's no more use trying to
freeze him down than calling a kangaroo dog off sheep.<pb n="200"/>
Binney's intelligent enough for anything in reason, but 
intelligence is no good in a case like this. You strike in, Tom;
you have all the Conservative arguments at your finger
ends. Binney's a stranger among us, and he's alone. Of
course, he's a strong Conservative -- and quite right, too,
being a farmer."

"I tell you he's an advanced Liberal, and firm in the
faith. He approves of the Land Act of '65, and the 
amending Land Act of '68."

"But we go beyond that," urged Thompson. "At least,
I think Furlong does; and certainly I do, and you may
swear Dixon's an out-and-out Radical."

"No, I be d--d if he is," protested Dixon, whose quick
ear had caught the aspersion. "I don't deny he's a rough
and ready sort o' person, but he ain't a Radical, nor never
was. Too many other (adj.) things to think about."

"That's all right, Dixon," said I, in an undertone. "But,
Steve, I don't see that anything can be done to help Binney;
and the only thing he could do to help himself would be
to tilt the Commodore into the ensanguined river. That's
the most approved, and only valid Conservative argument.
You'll notice that, in every right-thinking novel, the 
Conservative lays hands on the malcontent, and does him bad."

"But there's always two sides to a question," whispered
Thompson impatiently.

"And this is no exception, Steve; but, unfortunately, that
seasoned gladiator has taken the front side, leaving Binney
the residuary one. No doubt the thing is going to last till
morning, but I know Binney well, and I can assure you
that, under the Colonel's adroit handling, he'll never turn
a hair. Remember, he's an Englishman. Fifteen centuries of
fog have made him as impervious to all consciousness of
getting licked as the Deacon is to the barrenness of such
victories."

"But let us have some attempt at fair play, Tom."

"Well, I'll waylay the Major from time to time with
such of our Conservative arguments as have become
crystallised into aphorisms. Listen -- how far has he got?"<pb n="201"/>

". . . . And, therefore, Mr Binney, taking the law at its
very best, we should no more speak of an average citizen
as a law-abiding man than we should speak of a six-footer
as an eighteen-inch man. All ratios are capricious here, of
course, but I'm keeping well within the mark. And I think
I'm justified in saying that the established system of 
jurisprudence is the product of our highest faculties, just as the
most pernicious weed is the product of the richest soil.
The conception of organised, systematic and mutual
restraint marks us as demigods, but the present incidence of
that restraint marks us as missing links. However, this 
perversion won't continue. The change is hurrying on faster
than we're preparing for it. Think how many hide-bound
supporters of the Old Order have entered the pearly gates
since we sat down here this evening, and how many restless
young enthusiasts have taken their place! There has never
been a period of history when a current system was ageing
so rapidly and so helplessly, and a revolution was so 
unmistakably impending. Following on this revolution, there
will be sterner legal restraint than is now imagined possible.
The kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law. That
is the Socialistic ideal, Mr Binney. Give us laws Socialistic
in principle, with a system of mutual polity, and all things
are possible to man as a law-abiding animal."

"You can't make men virtuous by Act of Parliament,
Sheriff," I observed.

"You can make men anything you please by Act of
Parliament, Tom, provided that such Act is sanctioned by
a preponderant moiety of the national intelligence. On the
other hand, you may preach against any social-economic
atrocity till the death-rattle is in your throat; you may
write against it till death paralyses your hand; but if you
cannot enlist the operation of law, your labor is lost. I
might instance Wilberforce, Romilly, Garrison, Plimsoll,
and a host of other reformers, who shook off the name of
quack or faddist only when their quackeries or fads took
shape in law. The moral enlightenment of a majority,
though in the first place essential to reform, is merely a<pb n="202"/>
step toward the legislation which compels an immoral 
minority to fall into line. Avoid the sickly cant which claims
that Christianity -- representing the humanitarianism of
modern times -- has transformed the world without enlisting
the intermediate factor of legislation. Christianity must be
translated into secular law, and such law must be sternly
enforced, before it can neutralise the pride and 
covetousness so universally condemned in theory, yet so often 
condoned in practice. In national affairs, the office of moral
sentiment is to make beneficent legislation and rigid 
administration possible. This being effected, you may follow out
the operation of any legislative venture, and note its result.
And as a man's lifetime is only one tick of Chronology's
clock, and B.C. was the day before yesterday, we may take
the Spartan code as an illustration, peculiarly apt because
of its pronounced character and its rigid enforcement. This
code aimed at a certain citizen-ideal, and a certain 
helot-ideal, and both were attained to the letter."

"And what then?" I objected. "What has Sparta 
bequeathed to posterity, beyond that yarn about the boy and
the stolen fox?"

"Not much, indeed. Her laws stood in the way. You see,
the Spartan ideal was the soldier, pure and simple, and
omnipotent legislation crushed the aesthetic and philosophic
spirit, producing a nation of fighters, invincible for more
than four centuries. A most instructive and significant fact,
that, while legislation enforced courage, hardihood and
patriotism, to the exclusion of the more peaceful virtues;
that, while the accumulation of wealth was made impossible,
and all members of the community used the same iron
money, the only unfortified capital in the civilised world
was the only impregnable city. Remember, I hold no brief
for the Spartans, as a community. I dislike them. The point
at issue is the efficiency, or futility, of special legislation."

"These are but wild and hurling words, my lord," I
remarked presently. "In the name of the Prophet -- bunkum!
One would think, to hear you talk, that the man of wealth
and respectability is some kind of ogre. Isn't it evident, even
to you, that he can eat only three meals a day, and that he
can wear only one suit of clothes at a time?"

"He can eat five hundred meals a day, and wear one
hundred suits of clothes at a time," replied the Senator,
sweetly. "The chief object of civilisation is to furnish him
with a ton of food, and a case of drapery, every 
twenty-four hours. His very existence depends on this diurnal
supply, and to curtail it by one sack of spuds, or one case of
pickles, or one dozen pairs of pants, would be to fall under
the final condemnation. He was an-hungered, and ye fed
him not with a wagon-load of tucker; he was naked, and
ye clothed him not in a hundred plies of toggery."

"Mr Rigby!" murmured Binney, in grave remonstrance.

"Well," pursued the Colonel, "if it be true that he can
eat only three meals a day, and wear only one suit of
clothes at a time -- why, in Satan's name, should he be 
encouraged to impound, and retain to his own use, the
equivalent of food and clothes for a regiment of his 
fellow-mortals, all and each subsisting under the same natural 
requirements as himself? But stick to the food-and-clothes
argument, boys; it narrows the question down 
considerably."<pb n="204"/>

"In any case," said I, impatiently, "the rich man's wealth
is his own, to be disposed of as he pleases."

"Why re-state the difficulty?" asked the Major, wearily.
"Why not suggest some remedy for this disastrous 
ownership? If it wasn't his own, the matter could be dealt with
by laws already in force. 'Isn't the man mine?' asks the
owner of George Harris in *Uncle Tom's Cabin*; and no
one can gainsay the legality of his title. But as surely as
the national conscience of America has changed all that,
so surely in good time will the public conscience of the
civilised world rectify the abuse you speak of. 'His own,'
you say. What is the nature of his title -- legal or moral?
Remember that legal title is merely a matter of legislation.
The law which today upholds the ownership may tomorrow
be superseded by one which will invalidate it. Meantime, I
cheerfully grant his legal title. See that, in the event of
lawful annulment, you are as readily prepared to disavow
it. Now let us have a look at his moral title. If this be
sound, I have nothing more to say. Mind, I have seen too
much of the world to contend loosely that the man who
acquires wealth is accordingly an objectionable citizen.
Still less would I be inclined to denounce the man who
inherits it. I only hold that, as society is at present 
constituted, most generous qualities, though not all, are inimical
to worldly success; and most sordid qualities, though not
all, are furthersome. In other words, you may become rich
by the exercise of some of your good qualities, in spite of
the exercise of still nobler attributes. How is that for a
concession? But we must strike an average. Let two young
men begin the world together, in any branch of industry
you choose to name; let them be exactly equal in point of
education, energy, ability, connection, and situation; let
one be amiable, chivalrous, truthful, benevolent; and let
the other be precisely the reverse. At the end of ten,
twenty, thirty, or forty years, which of the two is certain
 -- certain, I say -- to be in the better worldly position?
Come!"

But no one was fool enough to answer.<pb n="205"/>

"It will simplify the question," continued the General,
"if we assume our two characters to engage in transactions
with each other. The unscrupulous man comes prepared to
do things that the other will not do, and the latter is placed
at a disadvantage. So in ordinary intercourse with the
world, the man of what we call quixotic integrity is 
hampered by scruples to which the baser nature is a stranger. A
man is not likely to make good bargains whilst holding the
opposing interest paramount to his own. Then, as life 
consists wholly of details, and a groat a day, according to poor
Richard, amounts to a fabulous sum in the course of the
year, one of our characters becomes rich in lucre and
the other in experience. But, broadly speaking, that is the
history of the handsome fortunes, acquired or inherited,
which qualify their owners for the uppermost seats in the
synagogue. The legal title (as Tom remarked just now) is
perfectly valid, and the moral claim -- on which the legal
pretension must ultimately be based -- will be wisely and
temperately discussed in Parliament by men who at the
present day are wearing copper-toed boots, or going 
bare-foot."

"No occasion for alarm," remarked Binney, after a pause.
"Your system is outside the range of practical politics. It
would press too hard on personal liberty."

"Worse, still," I added; "the Irishman wouldn't be able
to get his new boots on till he had worn them for a few
days."

"I don't attempt to gloze over that difficulty," replied
the General. "Your Irishman has worn the old brogans
till his feet are copiously decorated with corns and bunions.
But he will wear the new boots as the otter climbed the
tree. (Otters don't climb, but the specimen in the story *had*
to climb, the dog was crowding him so.) Hard conditions,
aren't they? Yet the hardness of the conditions doesn't
affect the necessity for accepting them. The commodious
tree of State Socialism is in front of us; the ravenous hounds
of monopoly, capitalism, and competition are behind, 
gaining upon us with every step of civilisation, and already <pb n="206"/>
snapping the weary and heavy-laden by tens of thousands.
Presently the survivors will see the expediency of becoming
arboreal animals, rather than dogs' meat. Mind, I don't
minimise your estimate of the difficulties and objections
that lie in the way to a perfect system. Consider that 
Socialism will have to operate, in the first place, on the product
of Individualism. But there is a wide difference between
difficulties and objections. Israel, fresh from the 
brick-making industry, proved fit for nothing better than to die in
the wilderness."

"By (sheol) you're right," interposed Dixon warmly.
"Enterprisin' lot o' subjects them was. 'Fetchin' us into the
wilderness to (adv.) well die,' says they. Stick to that
(adj.) argyment, Rigby."

"Good," replied the Judge, turning appreciatively to
Dixon. "And you will notice that the default was in the
material, not in the enterprise. Similarly, the two or three
generations which feel the first pressure of our 
social-economic transition will doubtless produce a fair crop of
murmurers and mutineers and worshippers of the golden
calf."

"And for all time you'll have human nature to deal
with," I objected.

"Can you imagine any better material?" asked the
Doctor, compassionately. "But what *is* human nature? By
what order of mind, by what product of training is human
nature represented to your imagination? Consider that not
one of the million types of adult sinner, nor a compound of
them all, can serve as an example of human nature. These
are our failures. These are the lame and the blind, that are
hated of David's soul. Yet human nature, uncontaminated,
is always with us. And though we industriously misdirect
its potencies, and jealously crush its latent capacity for a
higher life than our own, the supply of fresh material
never runs out. Trust the order of things for that. The 
unsophisticated child is human nature *per se*. And of such is
the kingdom of heaven, namely, the Divine 
Commonwealth which we aim at establishing. Happily, on all sides<pb n="207"/>
we see it demonstrated that crude human nature may be
educated to any form of government, without involving the
slightest outrage on inherent moral constitution; and I 
confess that I don't see any reason for drawing the line at that
merging of private interests in public welfare which 
Socialism demands. Why should the adaptability of human nature
fall short just here, and nowhere else?"

"The naythur o' the baste, no doubt, Deacon," I 
suggested.

"Shall we inquire wherein lies the oppugnancy?" pursued
the Colonel, with a touch of sadness in his tone. "It lies in
one of two moral diseases -- the leprosy of Selfishness, or the
palsy of Hopelessness. Now let each of you recognise and
acknowledge his own personal disqualification. One or the
other of these maladies has unavoidably been acquired by
each of you from the social-economic atmosphere of our
day, and has afterward been sedulously cultivated, to the
perdition of the patient. Hopelessness is as fatal to progress
as selfishness, and therefore as blameworthy. The fearful
are placed in most uninviting company by a man who
studied morals and metaphysics in the seclusion of Patmos.
He fixes them at the head of a list which includes 
unbelievers, murderers, and idolators as its decentest 
components. But confidence is one of the characteristics of 
unalloyed humanity as personified in the child. Nature is 
incorruptible; her cyclic reversion to the norm is 
continuous, and the unfailing receptivity of the norm makes all
things attainable. Also, the egoism, inseparable from flesh
and blood, may be softened to generous initiative, instead
of being hardened to selfishness. Every child begins life as
an actual democrat and potential Socialist. There was a
time when your own human nature would not have 
cavilled at an aspiration toward perfection in mundane 
conditions. Ay, better the millstone and the depths of the sea
for your seducers than your own moral ruin. Better, 
moreover, that you yourselves should be similarly dealt with
than that you should inveigle potential heroes into the 
insignificance of self-seeking. But reassure yourselves on one<pb n="208"/>
point. Socialism has no propagandist designs upon any
person self-doomed to die in his sins, as the inevitable 
penalty of contumacy. Just as each liquid body congeals at a
given temperature, so each man, at a certain period of his
thought-life, solidifies into moral immobility, and when
that phase is attained -- provided the subject has frozen into
individualistic shape -- Socialism has no message for him, no
interest in him, no words to waste upon him. We don't
seek him as an ally; we prefer him as an adversary. Ephraim
is joined to his idols; let him alone. Still, I never like to
assume this or that man to be the avowed enemy of unborn
generations. Even Tom, here. But to return to our 
illustration of the Israelites, as being somewhat less personal.
Moses had a very vile phase of human nature to deal
with --"

"My (adj.) oath!" assented Dixon.

"Joshua had an entirely different one. The race was
the same, but a fearless experiment in trenchant democratic
legislation and autonomous interdependence --"

"Holy glory," muttered Dixon enviously. (He mistook
the Major's rhetoric for classical quotation.)

"-- had superseded the old environment of sottish slavery,
and the effect was a complete metamorphosis of national
character. Why, human nature is plastic as the clay from
which it is derived; the only question is, What shape will
we give it? Our collective moral nature, in its response to
the contact of laws, usages, and culture, is subject to rules
of scientific exactness. Given certain social-economic 
conditions, it becomes the statesman's business -- everybody's
business, for that matter -- to divine, by fair induction, the
effect of those conditions on any class or nation, knowing
assuredly that, for better or worse, a determinate effect
will follow the given cause. Again, given the character and
conduct of any class or nation, it is simply a matter of
deduction to determine the social-economic conditions
under which that class or nation has developed. An 
intelligent contemplation of your Chinese colonists is equal to
the careful study of a book on the laws and usages of China.<pb n="209"/>
So also with your English, Scotch, Irish, French, German
colonists. And from these heterogeneous elements your
own social-economic conditions -- such as they are -- are
already evolving a corresponding type; Australian in ethics,
aspiration, impulse, and adjective. If the conditions were in
any way different from what they are, the product would
correspond with that difference. It is almost impossible to
over-rate the mobility of our race. We fashion our 
social-economic conditions, Mr Binney; these create environment;
this moulds the individual; and the individual is the State."

"But environment can never make all men think alike,
Colonel," I sneered. "You must take cognisance of the
other hackneyed term, namely, heredity. No use trying to
take out of the skin what is ingrained in the bone."

"No use at all, Tom. And the most noteworthy attribute
of the human bone is its tendency to symmetry, when 
circumstances are in any way conducive. I endeavoured to
make this clear by referring to the Israelites; but take a
more modern instance of moral transformation in one 
generation while I think of it, an instance which resembles the
former in no respect whatever, except as illustrating the
utter rottenness of the doctrine of moral heredity. Imagine
a party of nine British man-o'-war's men, stained with every
vice under heaven; in fact, a particularly rough and 
insubordinate sample of such scum as ruled the waves a century
ago. Now let these be fitly matched with she-savages of a
race absolutely oblivious to morality in any shape or form,
and distinguished even among Polynesians for cruelty.
Isolate this party, with half a dozen more savages of assorted
sexes, in a land where the terms of existence are as easy
as they ought to be in Australia at the present time. Then
let all the he-devils, bar one, perish by mutual assassination
within four years, leaving the survivor to think the matter
over, and to train a brood of half-caste brats on New 
Testament lines, as far as his illiteracy will allow. The result is
seen in the Pitcairn Islanders, the most blameless race on
earth. Of course, the future of this people, influenced by
contact with your civilisation, is another matter altogether.
The point at issue now is moral heredity."

"Collins might have mentioned another hackneyed term,"
remarked Binney, after a pause. "I mean variety. And
Socialism quietly overlooks the great fact that the variety
in minds is as wide as the variety in faces."

"Socialism builds upon that very identical fact," replied
the Ironclad. "That is the natural provision which makes
our system possible as well as desirable. Socialism proposes
to avail itself of the very best that each man or woman has
to give, offering, in return, a full share in the universal best,
along with such free scope for individual development as
cannot co-exist with anxiety for the morrow. Our purpose
 -- our only purpose-is to put to their highest use the 
 manifold gifts and energies hitherto atrophied or debased: to
interdict the sloth, and to curb the evil propensities, which
now make the majority of men a slur upon their alleged
Creator. Again, this variety in faces suggests a grave 
consideration. It postulates a common archetype, and thus
affinity is as clearly established as if all faces were facsimile,
whilst the incalculable advantage of diversity remains. Now,
if you grant a specific humanity, you necessarily grant a
fraternity which forces you to acknowledge the initial
equality of man in its strictest and fullest sense."

"Now, you're begging the question," interposed Binney.

"*Particeps* (adj.) *criminis*, strictly speaking," modestly
suggested the Latinist of our party. "No, no, what the<pb n="211"/>
(sheol) am I thinking about? *Petitio* (adj.) *principii* -- that's
the correct yabber."

"Thank you, Dixon," replied Binney, laughing. "Well,
Mr Rigby, you're drifting into the *petitio* (adj.) *principii*.
I don't recognise human equality, in its strictest and fullest
sense; nor does anyone who has seen the world."

"I do, for one, Mr Binney. I reason it out to the 
satisfaction of the Agnostic in three words, and to the utter
confusion of the so-called Christian in two. The argument
from Christianity is the only one that concerns us now.
See. The European grandee and the African nigger -- the
multi-millionaire and the penniless vagrant -- the brightest
genius and the profoundest fool -- are each adopted, on
equal terms, into brotherhood with the Redeemer. Either
this or nothing. And things that are equal to the same are
equal to each other. Explain that away, and you may
explain away anything and everything outside the field
of the five physical senses. As a Christian you place 
yourself under an iron jurisdiction, notwithstanding the law
of liberty which secures your individuality. Whoever
denies to the obscure specimen of humanity initial equality
in the fullest sense, thereby tacitly repudiates his own
relationship to Christ. A manifest sequence, since no man
can compass the alienation of another, though he may very
readily procure his own. And as the greater includes the
less, this paramount equality in spiritual rights and 
privileges carries with it a subordinate equality in temporal
rights and privileges. But there, be especially careful to
notice, the ordained equality ends, and each man fixes his
own personal status. There are heights of individual merit
to be scaled, and depths of individual baseness to be
sounded; but these are personal and optional, and can in
no way affect an independent, self-existent fact, coeval
with man -- a fact which is as valid now as in the days of
our common progenitor, Adam Fitz-Gibbon."

"Your argument gains nothing by its irreverence, 
Deacon," I remarked after a reflective pause.

"Parallel concessions to orthodoxy and science," <pb n="212"/>
explained the Judge. "However, let us in the first place avoid
confounding equality with uniformity --"

"One moment, Colonel," I interposed. "Are we to
understand that you State Socialists would concede 
freedom of entry and terms of equality to the few million
colored brothers named Sling Cat and Jamsetjee 
Ramchunder, who would promptly avail themselves of your
system?"

"Avail themselves of our system, did you say?" mused
the Sheriff. "Do inveterate and self-satisfied drunkards
seek membership in Rechabite Lodges? Heaven knows, we
would welcome either Chow or Baboo, provided he left
himself behind. We draw no color line, no educational
line, not even an intellectual line, but we fix a very distinct
standard of progress-potency. These Oriental gentlemen
have sold their birthright.

"'In the East,' says De Quincey, 'man is a weed.' Now,
man is not a weed by Nature's purpose, nor is he a weed
by compulsion. Collectively -- but in the first place 
individually -- he classifies himself. If his appraisement be low,
the inevitable exploiter may be trusted to keep him down
to his own valuation; if he holds himself to be the temple
of the living God, he will vindicate that claim -- he will
vindicate it as a triumphant leader -- if not as an effective
democrat. Millions of pseudo-Christian whites are quite as
objectionable as our colored brethren, but in point of
accessibility there is all the difference. For the Chow has
admitted finality; the Baboo has conceded despotism; and
both have got down to the husks. Yet these prodigals'
manhood, though suspended, is inborn, and will assuredly
assert itself at some future time. The first condition of
restoration is that the prodigal must 'come to himself. But
though propagandism is worse than useless here, I repeat
my argument for the initial equality of Ah Sin and
Juggernaut Gunga with the best of us -- an equality which,
rightly understood, has never been disturbed since the
yesterday when their ancestors were civilised men, and
ours were howling savages, barely able to grasp the <pb n="213"/>
scientific fact that two wolf-skins sewed together were wider
than one by itself. Yes, Mr Binney; a social system based,
as ours is, on the assumption that the fraternal relations
of mankind may be ignored, is no less unsound than any
theory in physical science which would purpose setting
aside the quality of gravity inherent in matter. This initial
brotherhood -- trite though the term may sound -- is not a
hypothesis that you are called upon to sift; it is the sternest
verity of life. You cannot get away from it, and you
cannot touch it without touching Christ, who is its centre.
This initial brotherhood is the stone which shall break
whosoever falls upon it -- by which figure of speech I
understand that those who seek to maintain any class 
privilege, hereditary, social, or economic, shall, in the last
resort, in the final test of supreme utility, be rated as moral
bankrupts. It is the stone which shall grind to powder
whomsoever it shall fall upon -- as happened, for instance,
in the French Revolution, and as will happen in the 
Armageddons of the future. It is the stone which shall yet
become a great mountain, and fill the whole earth. It is
the stone which the system-builders rejected 
eighteen-and-a-half centuries ago, and which is being --"

"That stone is Christ Himself," interposed Binney, with
the jealous reverence of a sincerely orthodox man.

"Precisely. Christ Himself. The Son of Man, in His
capacity as representative and standard of ideal humanity;
and therefore a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence
to the respecters of persons, in His own day. Oh, the issue
was clearly enough defined *then*. His purpose was to make
all things new; and the 'policy of the unsuccessful' (to
quote the Mammonites' dreary gag) was to hear him
gladly; whilst the policy of the successful was to take Him
by force, but that they feared the people, and eventually
to murder Him by strictly legal process. 'We have a law,
and by our law He ought to die.' Just so. Of course, if
Clovis had been there with his Franks -- if *we* had been
there with *our* Franks -- if the Scribes and Pharisees had
been in the times of the prophets with *their* Franks -- we<pb n="214"/>
would all have been on the right side. Make sure of that
as you value self-deception, make sure of that. And then
remember that though our fellow sympathisers' alternative
is gone, our own remains. Shall we then, or shall we not,
fall back on the shallow old shuffle, the cheap old 
compromise -- shall we compound for a current wrong by
damning an obsolete one -- shall we censure our fathers,
whilst falling into the modernised form of their error? Is
it the equalisation of opportunity and privilege -- in a word,
the virtual equalisation of condition -- that disturbs you?
Why, when the principles of Christianity were understood
by Christians, a voluntary surrender of private interests for
the public good, far beyond anything contemplated by
State Socialism, was taken for granted, and was regarded
as a privilege, not as a penalty. Just notice how easily the
economic question is dealt with in the Gospels, though it
forms such a large part of life. This is because the Gospels
are the purest Socialistic literature we have. No man ever
made out a case against the system on Christian grounds,
Mr Binney; and no impartial man, having looked into the
subject, now attempts to do so. Socialism represents the
secular side of Christianity; and" (here the Deacon 
hesitated a moment, and slightly lowered his voice) "the
hostility of the clergy to the movement is easily accounted
for, and is, in a sense, excusable. They recognise the river
which is to clean out the Augean stable of the Church.
Their craft is in danger. Deplorable as this wholesale 
flushing may appear, it is imperative; for the tendency of a
stable is not to become cleaner of its own accord."

"But why take the hazard of any experiment?" I 
demanded, snappishly. "Individualism *works*."

The General bent down his head, as if offering up a
silent prayer for patience.

"Yes, it works," he sighed. "So does autocracy -- yet
Parliamentary government has been instituted with 
advantage. Monarchy works -- but are we therefore to regard
Republicanism as an unclean thing? Savagery works -- but
is that any argument against civilisation? Polygamy and
polyandry work -- but do you therefore set your face against<pb n="215"/>
monogamy? Individualism works, no doubt, but with 
intolerable and increasing friction. You see, Mr Binney, not
only is the upper dog an Individualist, but likewise the
lower one; each for himself. The villainy taught by the
former, the latter will execute -- by compulsion, if not by
choice -- and it shall go hard with him, but he will better
the instruction."

"So Jack is as good as his master," I suggested 
contemptuously.

"Persuade Jack to the contrary, and his master will
clothe you in a belltopper, and make you the third ruler
in the kingdom," replied the Sheriff. "Individualism has
helped the lower dog to the great discovery you mention;
therefore, we have at last reached the time -- the first time
in history, mark you -- when a man's foes are they of his
own household. And 'household', in the English of James I,
doesn't mean 'family'; it means 'holders of the house' -- 
formerly chattel-slaves, now wage-slaves. The house is
divided against itself, and the breach is widening 
perceptibly year by year -- day by day, for that matter. But for
any possible disorder of the body politic there is, in the
very nature of things, an accessible, appropriate, and 
infallible remedy. In this case ours is State Socialism. What
is yours?"

"But is Socialism a remedy?" I asked querulously. "If
you divide everything today, how long will it be before
you require another division, and another, and so on?"

"Let some advocate of Individualism answer that 
question, since it concerns him alone," replied the Major. "For
this ebb and flow in private fortune, this rhythmic 
accumulation, confiscation and re-distribution of property 
confront us now as the most conspicuous feature in the
working of our present system, and one of the most
disastrous and demoralising. This perpetual division and
re-division of wealth is the distinctive outcome, and the
just and certain curse of Individualism, as compared with
any other 'ism' that we know of, and it is a curse, which,
thank heaven, is intensifying day by day --"

Pluck -- swish.

"I thought I would get him," remarked Furlong, quietly,
as his pliant rod bent to a semi-circle. He carefully rose
to his feet, propping both knees against an arched and 
denuded root. "This is his haunt, Thompson. Now, Dixon,
will you take this wooden hook, and watch your chance?"

In a few minutes, the fish was safely landed in a recess
behind a root, and it was a thirty-pounder, as nearly as
our carefully-concealed disgust would allow us to guess.
Probably there wasn't another such fish within miles.

(This, I ought to notice, was not the first catch of the
evening. Lushington, a couple of hours previously, had
secured a two-ouncer, without losing his bait. But I
allowed the little incident to pass unrecorded, in order to
avoid breaking into one of the Colonel's discursions, which
happened to be in full blast. In recounting the event here,
I am merely adjusting, not jumbling, the order of things -- 
transposing and grouping my occurrences, after the 
manner of some more famous, if less faithful, historians.)

"Better tether him in the river tonight," suggested 
Furlong. "We'll divide him amongst us in the morning."

"I've got the very thing," said I. "Hold on a minute."

I hurried to where I had left my earthly goods; there I
let Pup loose, and returned to the river with his chain; the
faithful animal following me down the bank.

We secured one end of the chain to the fish's gills, by
means of the strap, and attached the other end to a root.
The fish hadn't much room to play, his snout being close<pb n="217"/>
to the surface; but, at all events, he couldn't get entangled,
and he would keep fresh. Then, in tacit unanimity, we all
furled our lines, and began to climb the bank.

"Assuredly, Mr Binney," continued the Judge, as the two
made their way up the steep slope, "a greater number of
private fortunes have been dissolved and re-distributed
(amongst English-speaking people, at least) since the
middle of the century than in the two centuries preceding;
and, unless my forecast is unusually distorted, the 
remaining sixteen years of this century will break all previous
records, and do it easy. Doesn't every rich Individualist
dread the inevitable re-distribution of his wealth more
keenly than he dreads any other kind of perdition? And
doesn't every poor Individualist long for the golden shower
of other people's money infinitely more than he longs for
any other manifestation of his Maker's judicious 
partiality? The spoils to the victor -- but only temporarily."

"I beg your pardon," said Binney, good-naturedly.
"What time is it?"

"Early yet," replied the Deacon, advancing into the 
fire-light, and hastily glancing at his watch. "Shove on your
billy, Steve.

"Under our present system, Mr Binney, the strong man,
armed, keepeth his house only till a stronger than he
cometh, and taketh from him his armour wherein he
trusted, and divideth -- *divideth* -- his spoil. Every man of
substance would do well to think this matter over in his
intervals of leisure, bearing in mind that the inexorable
fitness of things demands some amendment more 
comprehensive than any patch of new cloth on the seat of the
old garment. And I maintain --"

"Good night," laughed Binney, extending his hand. "I
must break loose, sooner or later. Come on, Harold."

"Oh, hold on, Mr Binney; don't insult our camp like
that," remonstrated Thompson, who had replenished the
big billy, and was now adjusting it on the fire. "Great
Socialist, Rigby is," he continued, apologetically to the
farmer; "but it's more the power of controversy than the<pb n="218"/>
force of argument. An ounce of fact is worth a mile of
theory, they say; and while he was piling it on sky-high,
I just thought of a bit of logic that would knock all his
reasons and proofs into a cocked hat."

"Lay on, Macduff," sighed the Major.

"Gregory, remember thy swashing blow," I added.

"You know Stewart of Kooltopa, Jeff?" interrogated
Thompson, with forensic keenness.

"I do, Steve. I also once knew a slave-owner named St
Clair -- but my abolitionist principles remained unshaken.
A fine Socialistic captain of industry is lost in Stewart.
What a pity his only son, Watty, doesn't take after him."

"A mortal pity," assented Thompson, innocently. "Well,
I found the good of Individualism, and the folly of
Socialism, three years ago, when I lost that wagon and load
in the Eight-mile Mallee, and went to Stewart."

"One moment, Steve," interrupted the Colonel. "You
pretend to be able to track a single beast, day after day,
for a week. Now, how could you lose a wagon and load
in any mallee?"

"Oh, I could manage it right enough," replied 
Thompson, relapsing into the bitterness which had governed him
all the evening.

"Perhaps you'll take my word for it when you hear
the particulars. Tom and Dixon can ball me out if I 
exaggerate for the sake of proving my argument."

"It was one blazing hot day, January three years, 
continued Thompson, moodily, "and I was loaded for 
Poolkija, with five-ton-fifteen of all sorts. I was pushing on,
for I was tied to thirty days, and the station had sent me
a letter by the mailman to say that they had a couple of
well-sinkers stopped for want of some things I had on the
wagon. I was getting eight notes a ton; so I could expect
no mercy, and I didn't think I would want any. Laughed
at the very idea. I knew every drop of water and every
bite of grass within five mile of the track for the whole
journey, and my team was in rattling trim, but I overlooked
the fact that Providence has other ways of killing a dog
besides choking him with butter.

"Well, I was making that stage through the Eight-mile
Mallee, on Birrawong, and, about one or two o'clock, I
saw on ahead of me the smoke rolling up as black as a crow.
You know the place, Tom -- you too, Dixon -- and you know
it's about the heaviest porcupine in Riverina, and the track
through it only the width of a wagon. Of course, I jumped
on my horse and galloped on ahead to see which side of
the track the fire was on; but I found it coming along
both sides about a mile off, blazing twenty feet high, and
the draught of it carrying every leaf off the mallee as fast
as the flames touched them. I thought I had seen a couple
or three decent fires before, but I found I was mistaken.<pb n="220"/>
Must have caught alight just before I saw it, for it was
no width, but that didn't make any difference to me,
considering that we were both in the mallee together.
However, it happened to be a calm day, bar a breath of
wind now and then. So when I got back within a couple
of hundred yards of the wagon, I lit the near side of the
track and gee'd off into the porcupine, intending to get
past the fire and then cross the track into the burnt ground.
But I had only made matters a trifle worse, for in five
minutes the new fire was on both sides of the track. So I
bethought myself of an island of hop-bush half a mile away,
on the same side that I was on, and I went for it the rate of
knots, with the fire lathering along behind me roaring like
fury, and the sun invisible for smoke. The bullocks faced the
porcupine without a flinch, for they knew what was up as
well as I did, and I'd have made the island right enough,
only for the infernal thing that's on me.

"The first glimpse I got of some galahs in the hop-bush,
I saw that I was hanging too much to the right, and at the
pace I was going, I come-here'd and locked the wagon
badly. The pole happened to be none too good, on account
of a wrench it got a week before, so off it goes by the
fetchels. Of course, if there had been time, I could have
snaked her along with a spare chain; but there was the
fire not thirty yards behind, and the bullocks clearing off
with the broken pole, so I just unhitched the horse from
the back of the wagon, and grabbed hold of my coat on
account of the things in the pockets, and got the team
safe in the hop-bush, without two minutes to spare.

"Well, you know how clean the porcupine burns off, so
the moment the fire struck the hop-bush I got behind it,
and went to have a look for the wagon. There she was,
safe in the burnt ground, with nothing on fire except a
case of kerosene standing on top a big cask of sundries,
right in the middle of the load. Certainly the kerosene case
was blazing like a tar-barrel, for it had been three weeks
roasting in the sun, besides being soaked with the leakage
of the oil. I daren't poke it down for fear of setting fire to<pb n="221"/>
everything, but I had hopes of saving all the load, bar the
kerosene and the cask it was standing on, and if the sundries
happened to be anything fireproof I might save them too.
At all events, my first thought was full of real pious 
thankfulness -- hedging a little (if you understand me) till I could
see how things turned out.

"Well now, I had noticed, in loading the cask of
sundries, that it seemed to be a heavy, soddened, old 
ale-barrel, with a temporary top-end, made of pine-boards, so
roughly fitted that the straw and stuff inside stuck out
through the cracks. However, by this time the solder had
melted on the kerosene tins, and let all the oil down into
the cask; so the blaze was something that can better be
imag--"

"Don't, Steve," I groaned.

"How sympathetic you are, all of a sudden," sneered
Thompson, as he removed the billy from the fire, threw in
two handfuls of tea, and stirred it with the axe handle.
"Better be imagined than described. But even after the top
of the barrel had caved in, the sides were as sound as a bell.
I knew they would stand ten or fifteen minutes' roasting,
and my idea was to get my tarpaulin over the barrel and
stop the draught, so as to let the fire choke itself out. I had
dragged the tarpaulin into a safe place fifteen or twenty
yards away, first go off. So I jumped down off the wagon,
and went over to it and gathered it in my arms. I just
remember turning round towards the wagon, when 
suddenly there was a flare that blinded me, and an explosion
that shifted the firmament, and something hit the tarpaulin
such a welt that I went twenty yards before I landed; and
there I lay in a heap among the porcupine ashes, with the
tarpaulin on top of me. Seems sort of unmanly, you'd
think, to follow a person up in such a punctual, unmerciful
style, but, of course, it's not my place to lay down the
law.

"Well, by-and-by I woke up, sick as a dog, with my
face all scorched, and I lay down again. When I recovered
a bit, I just took an observation of the place, and gave it<pb n="222"/>
best. Reminded me of the abomination of desolation. In
spite of Rigby's very complimentary insinuation that I'm
a skite and a liar, the wagon was gone, body and bones,
and the principal thing that was left was a smell of powder.
There was a sort of wombat hole in the ground, where she
had stood, and a quarter of an acre of the burnt mallee
was badly knocked about; and outside of this you might
see such a thing as a spud, or an onion, or half a bar of
soap, or a partly-empty flour bag, or the matting off a tea
chest. The hind part of the wagon was about forty yards
away, lying in a heap, with the axle torn off the bed and
bent two double, and both wheels knocked into firewood,
and a whole swag of brass wire out of a piano tangled
round the lot. The only thing that was in decent order was
the fore-carriage and front wheels, lying upside down,
about twenty yards away. It was like something you would
dream about. And to make matters better, I had carefully
hung my coat on a mallee near the wagon when I started
fighting the fire, and where it went to I'll never know till
the day of Judgment."

"(Adj.) sight better to happen to you nor to a pore man,
anyhow," remarked Dixon, spreading an old wool-bale
on the ground.

"I'm relating this experience merely to prove an 
argument, and it's for the benefit of people with brains," replied
Thompson, severely, as he assisted Dixon to arrange the
tea-service. "Well, by the time I had found out that the
thing was a reality, it was near sundown. I made my way
back to where I had left the bullocks, but they had
wandered off across the burnt ground, with the horse 
following them. I tracked them for a bit, but night came on,
and I lay down, with a fearful headache, and a pain in
the inside. Off again at daylight, but before I had well
started I found the team, tied up in a knot, with the horse
close by. I took them on to the Coolaman Tank, and loosed
out there, and rode across to Rusty Jack's hut, to ask him
not to interfere with the bullocks, considering the way I
was situated. From there I dodged on towards Poolkija to<pb n="223"/>
give an account of my load. I believe I'd have suicided,
only I was too infernal frightened."

"Is that your anti-Socialistic argument, Steve?" asked
the Major, as Thompson paused in gloomy abstraction.

"I'm coming to it, if you'll only have patience. To give
old Forbes his due, he let me off as easy as could be 
expected. When I told him what had happened, and advised
him to send a horse and dray for anything that could be
collected, he told me I ought to be the last man in the
world to offer advice. Which was perfectly true. 'And now;
Thompson,' said he, 'if I might presume to throw out a
suggestion to you, it would be to put your horse in the
ration paddock for tonight, and go to the hut yourself;
and then, first thing after breakfast, clear off this station
before anything happens. Jonah would be a safer man to
have about the place,' says he. Of course, I followed his
advice. Now squat round here, boys, and help yourselves.

"When I got back to the fatal spot, I found a dozen
blackfellows having a good time of it, and a lot of emus,
and all the galahs and wee-jugglers in the country; for
there was over three tons of good tucker scattered about
 -- everything from jam to pearl barley. But I just picked up
a few things, and packed them on the fore-carriage, and
shook the dust off my feet for a testimony against that
Eight-mile Mallee, as the poet says.

"I bethought me that I had seen a good heavy platform
wagon in the shed at Kooltopa, besides the one they used.
So I drifted across there, to see if I could make some sort
of a deal for it. I told Stewart I was just as I stood, for it
had been arranged that both pockets of my pants had holes
in them at the time of my misfortune, and my coat was
gone to glory, with every copper I had buttoned up in
the breast pocket of it -- so I would have to ask for some
sort of terms. Stewart said -- well, no, he didn't want to sell
the wagon, but I was welcome to the loan of it. And, first
of all, he wanted me to start for Hay with four tons of
pressed skins, and fetch back six tons of stores. So here
was a god-send, and it took the feather-edge off my <pb n="224"/>
misfortune; and, if you'll believe it, from that day to this,
Stewart would neither take the wagon back nor listen to
one word about paying for it. 'Damn your soul,' says he,
'can't you keep the (adj.) thing till I ask you for it?'"

"Well, strictly speakin', Stewart don't count," observed
Dixon. "Divil thank him, he's a (adj.) Christian, he is. Here,
wire in, young feller" (this to Lushington), "what the
(adj. sheol) are you thinking about? What's come o' the
other gentleman?"

"He has retired to his camp," replied the clergyman,
helplessly. "He wishes to be alone."

"At first it made me feel as mean as a lord 
chamberlain," pursued Thompson, "but a person gets used to 
anything in course of time. Now, help yourselves, boys; no
politeness here. That's the same wagon," he added, by way
of clinching the argument, "only I got her thoroughly
overhauled before going out last wool season."

There was a pause.

"Well?" said the Judge, interrogatively.

"Well," replied Thompson, defiantly.

## CHAPTER XLII



- How subject we old men are to this vice of lying.
- {:.indent-6}Second Part of *King Henry IV*, Act III, Scene ii.
{:.poetry}


As the Social-economic controversy re-commenced, Dixon
deferentially touched me on the back with the edge of
his pannikin.

"Say, Collins -- onna bright -- what does *non omnia 
possumus* (adj.) *omnes* stan' for?" he murmured aside, 
unconsciously displaying the fearsome mnemonic power of
an unlettered but brainy man. "Is she straight? There ain't
no (adj.) possums in the ole country. I got that on good
authority."

"I think she's straight, Dixon, though I can't give you
the small change for her. I fancy you'll find her in any
good list of Latin phrases."

"Must 'a missed her some (adj.) road. Hunt her up
tomorrer. Say, them ole Latiners knowed how to git the
loan of a feller (adv.) quiet. Right. I'll work the (phrase)
for all she's worth."

Then we turned and took part in the conversation,
which, by the united efforts of Thompson, Binney, and
Lushington, had been forced round to Furlong's 
thirty-pounder. Some very good fish stories were told during the
repast. I remember I narrated how I had once caught 
half-a-hundredweight of fish with one large, fat maggot, on a
small hook, and still had the maggot to the good. I think I
laid the scene of this miraculous draught on the 
Murrumbidgee, but no matter. I had made the haul with a 
night-line, which I had casually-though, as it happened, 
fortunately-attached to the top of a very limber whip-stick 
sapling, trimmed clean of its leaves and twigs, and growing on<pb n="226"/>
the brink of the river. On visiting this line in the morning,
I had found the sapling bent down to the water, and had
easily landed an exhausted codfish of thirty-two pounds.
Inside him I had found another of fifteen pounds; inside
him another of six-and-a-half pounds; inside him again,
one of two pounds; inside him (if the cynical reader can
stand it), a bream of half-a-pound; and, inside the bream,
the maggot still serviceable. This story had grown, by
healthy and unconscious accretion, round a small, central
core of fact, retaining so perfectly the form of its nucleus
that, if you were to hear me tell it, you would perceive in
a moment that the probation held no loop or hinge to hang
a doubt on; so you would just try to excel it. This was
what the other fellows did; but when Lushington 
over-reached himself with a haul of eels from a 
northward-running Victorian river, our synod broke up in grief and
mortification; though the unhappy man remained 
unconscious of his own outrage on decency.

"I'll probably see you in the morning, Collins, before
you leave," said he, reaching up to unhook his two-ouncer
from the twig where he had hung it for safety. "I've
arranged to spend the forenoon with Smith. Good night."
So the kangaroo hunter's name was Smith.

Then all hands dispersed, and silence settled down on
the camp. By this time a sickly half-moon was past the
zenith, and the stars indicated half-past one or thereabout.

The Colonel, seeing me fold the aboriginal appurtenance
of my slumber, with the woolly side in, and spread it on a
clear place, near Dixon's wagon, removed his own bedroom
suite from the wagonette, and pre-empted an allotment
contiguous to my selection.

Contemplating him there, as he enjoyed the best smoke
of the day, I couldn't help reviewing his works and his
labor and his infatuation during the quarter-century he had
devoted to meddling in matters beyond the workman's
legitimate field of inquiry, and I retrospectively noted the
perverse and enthusiastic young Bayard slowly and surely
petrifying into the perverse and crotchetty old zealot,<pb n="227"/>
though, necessarily, in this casual memoir he passes with
barely an introduction.

"Memoir," I repeat, with sadness, for character is no
creation of a diseased fancy. Independent of the leaders,
and apart from all organisation, there are men -- intellectual
giants, very frequently -- behind the nefarious Socialistic
movement, poisoning the public mind with aspirations for
a state of things which would make life worth living. Our
ancestors knew how to silence these fellows. If legal 
process seemed doubtful, or public execution appeared 
undesirable, there was a quieter way. You might have
approached any one of my own Irish forefathers, furtively
pointing out a superfluous individual of the Rigby type,
whilst jingling a few shillings in your hand.

But, setting aside expediency, there is something well
worth study in the spectacle of a man, subject to the needs
and restrictions of flimsy mortality, challenging 
principalities and powers, and fatmen of all descriptions, with the
easy assurance of Jack the Giant-killer; and all 
gratuitously. Penalised by voluntary poverty, future-blind as
to himself personally, and indifferent as well, yet conscious,
like St Just, that there is no rest for revolutionists but in
the grave, such a man, be he right or wrong, certainly
attains manhood. But he is a stranger to manhood, who has
never suspected an impudent libel in the term "interested
agitator". Ah, heaven! Conservative as I am, no sophistry
could blind me to the fact that any man gifted with the
special order of brains requisite to agitators can bring his
goods to a market where profits are greater and returns
quicker. The alternative of apostasy is always open, and
there is joy amongst us over one blackleg of maximum
ability and minimum integrity.

But the agitator is a man, who, for reasons satisfactory to
himself, though inscrutable to people of self-bounded 
horizon, chooses the dinner of herbs and hatred therewith,
rather than the stalled ox where love is. Not that he is
enamoured of the many uninviting personal traits generated
and fostered by poverty, but that he hates these moral<pb n="228"/>
blemishes bitterly enough, and wisely enough, to attack
them at their source. One object only has he in common
with the mass of his disciples -- the object, namely, of their
own economic advantage. Beyond this point, his Satanic
isolation begins. To Brown, Jones, and Robinson, material
prosperity is in itself a sufficient end, an end beyond which
their sober wishes never learned to stray; to him the same
temporal well-being is but a necessary means towards 
unprecedented expansion of latent moral, mental, and
physical faculties. He recognises, as clearly as we do, the
chaste beauty of plain living and high thinking; but he
also knows that when living is forced down to a certain
degree of plainness, the thinking is not likely to be as lofty
as could be desired; and herein lies the goading motive of
his harsh evangel. To brand him fanatic is just -- the just
penalty of being born too soon; to picture him wild-eyed,
long-haired, and unwashed, may or may not be just, and
indeed makes little difference either way; but interested,
in the sense intended, merely furnishes impertinent people
with a standard whereby to gauge the moral stature of the
censor.

I am in the habit of relating a pretty stiff lie about
Rothschild and a Socialist. One of the Rothschilds, 
travelling by rail in France, encountered an interested agitator,
and the two fell into discussion. Finally, Shylock took out
his tablets and made a calculation: "My fortune is so many
million francs; this, amongst so many millions of 
population, comes to so many francs, so many sous, per head.
There is your share, *mon ami*; take it and hold your tongue."

My custom is to assume that this neat little fib sizes up
the whole question; but, between ourselves, it does nothing
of the kind. It only sizes up the man Rothschild. The points
unintentionally illustrated in the parable are -- this fatman's
sordidness of soul, and his unwarrantable judgment of an
ideal altogether beyond his apprehension.

But my under-current of thought was persistently 
dwelling upon that glimpse into the Never-never of my <pb n="229"/>
companion's soul, happily vouchsafed to me when our 
acquaintance was only a couple of years old.

Again and again I recalled that incoherent outburst of
undying love, which showed the effective and confident
lord of creation to be commanded, like Cleopatra, by such
poor passion as the maid that milks and does the meanest
chares. These memories were, of course, associated with
that mysterious, end-shaping operation of Providence which
had brought the sundered Down-Easters together at last.
But to what purpose? There seemed to be some sort of
rift in the banjo. Surely I couldn't be mistaken unless there
were visions about.

- This wreck of a realm -- this deed of my doing --
- For ages I've done, and shall still be renewing.
- {:.indent-6}Byron's *Manfred*.
{:.poetry}


"It moves, Tom."

"I know it does, Colonel, but we needn't force that fact
on an unscientific public. Galileo got into trouble through
not being able to keep the same item of information to
himself. Let it move. By the way, you struck form 
tonight; I've seldom seen you more insulting to visitors."

"Was I? Possibly my conventional pliancy was disturbed
by some good news I received this afternoon -- or rather,
a handsel of good to come."

"I'm glad to hear it," said I, with sincerity. "I couldn't
make you out tonight at all. I fancied there must be some
hitch in the sequence of things, and I was beginning to
despair."

"Hardly as explicit as it might be," observed the Major,
complacently critical. "However, as a Conservative, you
have reason to despair. The Socialistic harvest is plenteous,
however few the laborers may be. That Furlong, for 
instance, is worth looking after."

"Just you let the man alone, Deacon; he never did you
any harm."

"Binney's a hard case, by reason of his stake in the
country," continued the Judge reflectively. "Lushington is
impervious, because of his pernicious training. Steve is
hopeless, owing to his constitutional lack of ardor. Dixon,
of course, is Dixon, and, for yourself, motley's the only
wear. But I have Furlong already tempering between my
finger and my thumb, and shortly will I seal with him."<pb n="231"/>
"Oh, you're speaking of your commission with the
Emperor Nicholas. Don't you see it's a failure, and likely
to continue so?"

"And why, pray?"

"In the first place, General, a reformer ought to have a
programme, and you have none; in the second --"

"One moment, Tom. Don't mistake me for an organiser.
I'm merely an agitator, a voice in the wilderness, preaching
preparation for a Palingenesis. The programme is hidden
in the order of events, and will be evolved in its own good
time. To be fettered by a programme now would be fatal.
The 'man of affairs' will not be lacking; let us recognise
him when he appears. The formulation of a hard and fast
system is the prevalent mistake amongst apostles of our
cult. Principles only are vital; and how often have these
been obscured and subverted by insistence on details. If
we assuaged our zeal by bearing in mind that Socialism is
relative, not absolute -- that it must come by evolution, not
by miracle -- we should be much further ahead than we
are. As a matter of course, each parable relating to the
Kingdom of God gives us one aspect of Socialism. In this
instance, you will remember that a morsel of leaven was
hidden in three measures of meal, till the whole was
leavened."

"Why, then, did you lead Binney to believe that
Socialism meant the abrupt confiscation of farms, and the
degradation of farmers to the ticket-of-leave level?"

"Do you think he apprehended it so? How far is it to
his place?"

"A mile and a half as the crow flies."

"I must give him a call. But, to meet your objection
satisfactorily, I'm only a watchman, imperfectly qualified,
I admit, though Divinely commissioned. And, as with
Jeremiah's sentinel, if I fail to sound the trumpet, I shall
render myself responsible for the catastrophe which a timely
warning may avert. I pretend only to be cognisant of
certain facts, which may be ticked off consecutively. Here
they are. Up to the present generation popular intelligence<pb n="232"/>
advanced, at best, by arithmetical progression. The outcome
is a thing that serves all the useful purposes of oppression.
Oppression maketh a wise man mad. A wise man mad is
formidable; and wise -- at least, relatively wise -- men are
not as scarce now as formerly. Nothing but large and
repeated concessions on the part of the classes can avert a
collision. The classes will make no adequate concession,
and the new wine will burst the old bottles. There you
have the argument of a drama in which the Socialist takes
no part beyond that of the Greek Chorus -- a mouth-piece
of the author's principles and sympathies. But at the close
of this drama, the Socialist takes the leading part. The blind
reaction from an individualism grown unendurable will
not take him by surprise. His spirit is acclimatised to the
new order; and he is therefore qualified to stand as the
prophet of hope in a doomed and perishing system. Now,
let's hear your second quibble."

"It's a homely one, Doctor; yet it contains the number
one key to your magnificent failure as a mischief-maker;
'altruistic', and 'deontological', and 'iconoclastic', and
'ochlocratical' are the simplest words you use; and the
trackfaring bloke, being clothed with illiteracy as with a
garment, errs in his interpretation. In a word, you are too
sesquipedalian."

"Meant sarcastic," murmured the Colonel. "Perhaps my
rhetoric is rather reminiscent of the sequel to the First
Book. So mote it be. I speak to be understanded of the
people, not to entertain hearers who must have a jig or a
tale of bawdry, or they sleep."

"You were on the religious racket tonight, Deacon," I
remarked.

"All things to all men," replied the Judge sententiously.
"Talking to an agnostic, I dwell on Proudhon's 'Property
is Robbery'; talking to a so-called Christian, I dwell on the
Psalmist's 'The earth is the Lord's' -- the same solid axiom,
varied slightly in expression. But, broadly speaking, I'm
always on the religious racket; for my game is man, and
man is a religious being; moreover, the person whom you<pb n="233"/>
would call non-religious, I usually find the most apt, 
inasmuch as he is already free from the incrustation of 
sanctified selfishness. State Socialism must be built on a 
foundation of religion, rightly so-called. There is no other 
foundation possible. Note any moral characteristic, or social usage,
of any race or nation, and you'll find some religious tenet
underlying it. And what appears to me the most inspiriting
sign attendant on our movement is the intensely religious,
the fearlessly righteous tone of its current literature. The
opposing literature is, of necessity, frankly materialistic, or
transparently evasive; and herein lies the most encouraging
weakness of the individualistic position. But even that
position requires the soothing justification of religion;
wherefore the clergy of all denominations, by judicious
suppression, perversion and manipulation of what they call
the revealed will of God, make shift to meet the 
requirement. The resultant is a poor religion, sir; an ill-favored
thing, sir, but their own. This leads up to another 
consideration; to wit --"

"I beg your pardon, Major," I interposed. "You were
saying you got a pleasant surprise this afternoon?"

"Ah, yes. I got two letters today, forwarded from
Echuca. One was from Waghorn, acknowledging my
notification that I expected to place the result of my work
in his hands very shortly, and informing me that he had
collected some statistics which had not been available to
me. But my gratification arises out of the other letter. It
was from Milligan Brothers. You may remember that
about four years ago I parted from them on the very best
of terms, after a couple of years' fairly successful 
exporting of the Mohawk wirebinder. They're importing a string
machine this year -- good enough for a new thing, but as
yet requiring a certain amount of brain-worry and 
objurgation. However, I had opportunity to watch the two trial
machines that were in operation last harvest, down in the
late districts, and at sight of the trouble, my spirit lusted
to undertake the old game with the new machine. So a
fortnight ago -- the end of my present engagement being<pb n="234"/>
then in sight -- I wrote to Milligan Brothers, offering my
services again, and leaving the question of wages with
themselves. I had their reply this afternoon, written as a
memo, on the corner of my letter. They declined to
employ an agitator."

"And you find satisfaction in this?"

"Well, I should say so. While any far-reaching reform
is in the air, it excites no opposition worth mentioning, but
rather a sentimental sympathy; once it approaches what is
conventionally known as the range of practical politics,
it will suit any active advocate of that reform to be a
single man. At last the hand-writing is visible on the wall,
Tom .. . Still, I don't know . . . The memo, was evidently
written by Leslie Milligan; and he's the most astute man of
my acquaintance. He can see ten years further ahead than
the average Conservative does -- in other words, he can see
a decade ahead of the present moment. I mustn't build too
much on his hostility." The Deacon sighed, and placed his
pipe carefully on the rim of his hat.

"It was so in Wesley's time," he resumed. "The 
Episcopalian clergy were interested and amused by his 
discovery of the 'new birth', and so forth; but when the State
Church was menaced by defection, the thing seemed to
have got beyond a joke. *Then* those ministers of the Gospel
thought they were doing God service by hounding the
little apostle from parish to parish, with all available
ignominy. It was so in the time of Rousseau. While reform
seemed an affair of the Greek Kalends, his diatribes,
crowned by the *Social Contract*, entertained and interested
the aristocracy. (Strange, by the way, how unwarrantably
temperate the tone of that epoch-marking book appears to
us now.) He never lacked patrician patronage, resent it as
he might. The inveterate misery of his life was owing to
unfortunate personal qualities, not in any way to his
resolute challenge of the social lie; but if he had lived a
few years longer, a handsome reward would certainly have
been offered for his head. And there was a time when
negro emancipation was sentimentally discussed by <pb n="235"/>
slave-holders as an interesting moral question. In the guise of an
abstract idea, it was highly fashionable; but presently it
assumed the form of a concrete policy, and then, *then* the
righteous anger of the former sentimental theorists found
expression in assassination, lynching, tarring and 
feathering. So it will be with Socialism. But passive waiting is
weary work. Defoe, in the pillory for liberty of conscience;
earless, but unconquerable; Wesley, dripping from a 
horse-pond, yet intrepidly preaching what he conceived to be
the truth; old John Brown, doggedly insisting upon his own
execution as a felon by State law; it seems to me that
under such stimulating conditions the squalor of human
life is half cancelled, and pride becomes pardonable."

"My word, you're right, Colonel," I replied, controlling
my emotion.

The Major paused, and lapsed into reverie. But Dixon,
reposing close beside us in his wagon, had been following
the thread of argument with his usual crude intelligence,
and now remarked, in a thoughtful tone, "Yes, chaps, I was
readin' about them (adj.) things las' winter, on Kooltopar.
*The Army of Martyrs* was the name of the (adj.) book.
Swapped *Harry Stottle* for her. Awful the set them 
Catholics used to put on pore misfortunate individuals, jist for
bein' too (adv.) good. Frightened (sheol) out o' me at
the time, on chance of another (adj.) persecution.
Wouldn't suit me no (adj.) road. I'd say, 'Slack off, for
Gossake; I'll confess anythin' you (adv.) well like.' Cripes,
yes; like a bird. (Adv.) little pigheadedness about this
child, if there was any git out. Anyhow, them sort o' things
is did away with now; an' we got a right to be thankful,
(adv.) thankful, if you ast me anythin' about it." A long
sigh of relief; a few half-intelligible expletives of devout
gratitude; and presently the slow, regular breathing of the
Australian Cuddie Headrig proved that the sectarian 
discords of former ages had little power to break his rest.

Again my mind reverted to the marvellous tactics of
Destiny, as revealed to me during the day; and I wondered
at the apparent pettiness of the issue. I would dissemble --<pb n="236"/>

"Thinking of the mad days you have spent, and how
many of your old acquaintances are dead?" I conjectured,
after a pause.

"No," replied the Judge; "my thoughts took a more
cheerful, and no less quotable turn. I was sending my
bright, far-seeing soul three centuries in the van."

Again there was a minute's silence.

"I say, Sheriff, did you ever notice that in the 
'Shakespeare Plays' there are more women named Kate than
anything else? Why is this thus?"

"I never noticed it; but I believe you're right. And those
characters are all amiable, or piquant, or both. The 
wherefore of the thusness, I should say, might possibly be found
in the hypothesis that the author loved some woman of that
name. Now, if you ascertain by historical research, or by
the shorter cut of nomenology, whether this applies to
Bacon or to Shakespeare, you'll be doing work worthy of
your ambition."

Another minute's silence.

"Asleep, Colonel? Do you know what was the name of
the original Flying Dutchman?"

"Van Straaten, originally; but known to British sea-gulls
as Vanderdecken. A profitable and engaging study, I should
say, in view of the couple of years you have to live."

"Life itself is a dream," I sighed, "and the world is not
even a stage -- it's a badly dislocated magic lantern picture;
and the men and women are not merely players, they're
barely phantasms. But *lux ex* (adj.) *oriente*, as Dixon would
say. Nothing exists but Brahm. Far away back in the
genesis of time, Brahm took forty winks; and what has
seemed to happen since then has been a fugitive dream,
that is still crossing his mind. He may wake at any moment,
and then we will pass away, as if we never had existed. In
fact, we never did exist, except as immaterial conceptions in
that momentary."<pb n="237"/>

"____!"

It was about the third time, during an intimate 
off-and-on acquaintance of twenty-three years, that I had heard
such an expression from the Major. He sprang to a sitting
position, and glared at me in the sickly moonlight.

"Fie for shame, Deacon. A snake?"

"Oh, damn you, Tom. Why didn't you remind me?"

"Remind you of what?"

"How came you to suggest that name, just now?"

"Simply through wondering to see how little interest
you took in an old acquaintance. I've been thinking of her
all the evening."

The Sheriff groaned. "It's not your fault, Tom. I beg
your pardon. No one is to blame but myself. I'll tell you
what I've done. I was engaged to spend the evening with
Miss Vanderdecken -- and you see how I've managed the
thing. Oh hell."

"Well, to tell you the truth," I replied, "I wondered
to see you leave her so soon, and take it so coolly all the
evening. You knew her in the old country -- didn't you?"

"I believe I did. I'm certain I did. Talking to her, this
afternoon, my mind was in a haze; there seemed to be
some old memory associated, not only with the people and
places she spoke of, but with herself. I couldn't determine,
just then, whether it was an actual reminiscence or an
occurrence of unconscious cerebration -- a thing I'm very
subject to -- and I was afraid of committing myself by <pb n="238"/>
pretending to recognise and remember her, when I might turn
out to have been merely a resident of her neighbourhood
when she was a child. On the other hand, if I actually did
know her, it would never do to have forgotten her. Women
are very sensitive to this kind of remissness; they regard it as
a slight. So in order to gain time, and to get a better grasp
of the position, I excused myself for an hour, on the plea
of attending to something at my camp. I intended asking
you to post me up a little, for you had spent an hour or
two in her company, and she talks well. I was to have
returned at eight o'clock -- but then, the ruck of company
and that accursed thirty-pounder. . . . What will she think
of me now? Heaven above."

"You can apologise to her in the morning," I suggested.

"Of course I shall do so, but that doesn't cancel this
hideous default. This is the sort of thing that makes me
tired of life, Tom."

There was a short silence, broken only by an occasional
ejaculation, or a deep sigh, from the stricken agitator. I
was just dropping off to sleep, with the thought that there
is something not altogether unpleasing to us in--

"I say, Tom."

"Here, your worship."

"Do you know, I fancy I made love to that woman once."

"I don't believe you, Senator."

"I can hardly believe myself. . . . Yes . . . Kate 
Vanderdecken. . . . Same grey eyes . . . Same bright hair. . . .
Same soft, slow voice . . . The old, forgotten memories are
coming to light."

"'Like Roman swords found in the Tagus' bed,' as the
poet observes," I suggested sympathetically.

"Kate Vanderdecken . . . Yes, Kate Vanderdecken,"
pursued my Azim-hero critically. "And she remembered
me . . . What on earth . . . I'll never forgive myself . . .
Now she particularly impressed me, this evening, as being
decidedly the most engaging woman I ever met. Indeed, I
remember that, as I came down along the fence, I fairly<pb n="239"/>
shuddered at the thought of having such a flower of
womanhood for a wife."

"On account of the imaginary other fellow?" I 
conjectured. "The thought was unworthy of you, General."

"Now, for heaven's sake, don't judge anyone else by
your own standard. I was thinking of the time I would lose
if I lived in such an atmosphere. That is accounted for now.
And to slight her after this fashion. Oh hell. I've put my
foot in it, this time."

And the Colonel, whose verbal cynicism veiled the most
sensitively considerate spirit that ever made man miserable,
writhed and fumed in undignified remorse.

"Surely there's some variety of sickness that might come
on a person in the evening and go away before morning
without leaving any trace?" I hinted.

"Oh, shut up. It's dreadful -- damnable -- beyond 
precedent, and beyond forgiveness --" And thus the unfortunate
Major continued reviling himself, whilst I dozed off to
sleep, tacitly accepting his penitence as sufficient atonement
for a default which, after all, would add some twelve or
fourteen hours to a twenty-five years' estrangement.

About three hours later -- just as the middle distance was
becoming faintly visible in the cool, fresh dawn, and
about fifty cocks were vigorously proclaiming the 
neighbourhood an agricultural, not a pastoral, one --I was 
awakened by a weight across my neck, a stertorous breathing
close to my uppermost ear, and an overwhelming smell of
fresh fish in my nose. Then I became aware of the faithful
Pup, lying at my back, his throat pillowed on my neck,, and
his fine, Osiris-like muzzle resting against my moustache.
The pulmonary symptoms already noticed, together with
the capitalistic contour of the noble animal's stomach,
when I turned to look at him, bred a suspicion which was
verified when I jumped up and ran to the river, just as I
was.

I had noticed the water falling rapidly whilst we were
fishing, and since that time it had gone down something
over a foot. Now, here was Furlong's fish, partly dragged
and partly swung to a horizontal root, just above the water
level, where the skeleton still lay, and all around the wet
clay was impressed with tracks very much resembling those
of a large kangaroo dog. Thus everything was explained.
As a rule, only fishermen's dogs will eat fish; it is an acquired
taste, like the appreciation of Walt Whitman amongst 
ourselves. But the kangaroo dog is independent of all epicurean
rules and limitations. Like the Gentiles, he is a law unto
himself.

I took a branch of prickly scrub, which had been
stranded among the roots, and thrashed away all the<pb n="241"/>
tracks; then threw the branch into the river. Everything
being thus nicely tidied up, I slipped back to my nest, and
went to sleep again -- after noticing, by the way, that Smith
was saddling his horse for an early start. Another good hand
at keeping appointments, I thought.

"Awake, Aeolian lyre, awake."

It was the Judge's voice, as he laced his boots. The sun
was showing through the river timber eastward, and all
the fellows were up for the day. Furlong passed by, with a
cordial salutation, and went down the bank -- the Colonel
following him, to assist in the convoy of his fish. By the
time I was dressed, the two had returned empty-handed,
and were dawdling across to where Dixon was putting a fire
together. Thompson, with Dixon's pipe in his mouth, and
heaven's own felicity in his face, was going straight toward
the relics of the fish for a bucket of water. I joined the
group at the fire; and presently Thompson returned with
his supply of water.

"This'll hold enough for all hands," he remarked, as he
filled the big billy, and stuck it on the fire.

"Aren't we going to have some of the finny spoil for
breakfast?" I asked, with the lust of a gourmand.

"Spoil by name, and spoil by nature," murmured
Thompson pleasantly, as he arranged the fire-sticks around
the billy.

"I move amendment to snake up the (adj.) fish, an' fry
a dollop off o' the (same), if Furlong's agreeable," 
suggested Dixon.,

"First catch your fish," drawled the Major.

"I said, 'If Furlong's agreeable,'" replied Dixon,
pointedly.

"Oh, most certainly I'm agreeable," said the trapper, with
his melancholy smile.

Amongst well-bred bushmen, lack of information is
always carried off by august indifference; otherwise there
would be derogation of dignity. Of course, in cases where
assistance can be rendered or advice given, a certain 
chastened interest is even justifiable, but this interest must be<pb n="242"/>
purely objective, and entirely foreign to anything like
curiosity or solicitude. The bushman must know all that
may become a man; anything that he doesn't know (to
quote the antediluvian proverb) isn't worth knowing. So,
after a seemly interval, Dixon yawned, stretched himself,
glanced round the sky in casual observation of the weather;
then took down a towel from the branch of a sapling and
a piece of soap from the stump, and sauntered toward the
river. Each of us equipped himself in somewhat similar
manner, and listlessly drifted in the same direction. We
found Dixon, with his back to the fish, ostentatiously 
washing his face, and we all followed his example, conversing
apathetically about one thing or another. "Native cats?" I
speculated at last, indicating the organic remains by a
backward inclination of my head, after I had done washing.

"Couple of dozen of them," said Thompson, carelessly.
"Swear to their tracks. Fish has kicked himself out of the
water, and got lodged on that root. I must be off; the billy'll
be boiling over."

"'Native cat' is a misnomer," remarked the Senator, as
we climbed the bank. "The animal belongs to the
Dasyurida;, not to the Felidae. The distinction is an
extremely far-reaching one; it is more than specific, it is
generic. Worth knowing, that the Dasyuridae are peculiar
to Australia, Tasmania, and New Guinea; whilst Australia,
Madagascar and the Antilles are the only parts of the world
destitute of indigenous Felidae. Apparently, however, the
native cat is icthyophagous upon occasion, like the domestic
cat."

"Well, no; he ain't," replied Dixon, politely captious
toward a rival pedant. "He's always spotted -- white on top
o' yallerish grey. Now an' agen, he's spotted white on top
o' black, but that's on'y a case of *exceptio pro bat* (adj.)
*regulam*, as the sayin' is. Curious thing, Rigby, the natey
cat he'll eat any (adj.) thing, and no (adj.) thing'll eat
the natey cat."

However, we had no fish for breakfast.

That relatively impoverished meal being over, the <pb n="243"/>
Deacon arrayed himself to wait on his countrywoman. I
offered to accompany him, and he gladly consented, 
waiting with some impatience whilst I recovered Pup's chain
and secured the faithful animal in a shady place to give his
banquet a chance of sacking down wholesomely. 
Thompson, on his way to Binney's, rode beside us as far as the
pub. Then the General, silent and perturbed, followed me
into the front parlour.

"Wonderful weather for this time of year," remarked
Mrs Maginnis, who was re-arranging the things on the
mantelpiece. "Think we'll get some rain with the change
of the moon?"

"Hard to say," I replied critically. "The sun looks very
dry this morning. Can we see Miss Vanderdecken, or Miss
Flanagan, please?"

"They're gone," replied the landlady. "Went away just
after sunrise. I was up early this morning, for we set some
bread last night. Miss Vanderdecken heard me, and she
came out in the passage, and away goes the two of them and
the boy. She made me send the boss to harness up her
buggy, and I had to waken the boy while Lizzie was 
hurrying up some sort of a breakfast. She said she had a 
headache, but it would go away with the fresh air; and she
wanted to get back to Echuca; and she couldn't touch any
breakfast herself; and I begged and prayed of her not to be
in a hurry, and so did Miss Flanagan, for she looked real
bad."

"I should like to have seen her before she went,"
remarked the General, absently contemplating a porcelain
shepherdess on the mantelpiece.

"Well, she was expecting you last night, and quite 
uneasy," replied the landlady. "She as good as sent the boy
down to see what was keeping you."<pb n="245"/>

"The young brat never came," replied the Sheriff, with
ready malignity.

"Oh yes, he did, Colonel," I interposed. "He was sitting
beside me all the time you were diverting us with the
history of old Fitz," -- a shudder ran down to my boots as I
bethought myself --" Fitz -- Fitz?" I continued, racking my
memory, "Fitzgerald? -- Fitzpatrick? -- yes, Fitzpatrick. The
boy was fairly fascinated by your inferences and 
admonitions. You entertained a disciple unawares this time!"

"But he never gave me the message," said the Major,
doggedly.

"She didn't send any message, properly speaking,"
explained the landlady. "'Sam,' says she, about nine o'clock,
or five minutes past, 'ain't you going to see Mr Collins?'
Says she. 'You was taken with him today' -- or words to
that effect. And the boy said he'd been thinking of going
down, to give Mr Collins a few wrinkles about one thing
or another; and I spoke up, and said he had nothing to do
but follow the fence to the river. 'Well,' says she, 'when
you're there, you might take notice if you see Mr Rigby;
you'll see if he's busy or not. Course, you're going to see
Mr Collins on your own account,' says she, 'but I'd rather
you wouldn't speak to Mr Rigby, nor let him see you, if
possible.' So, in one sense of the word, she didn't send him,
but she was very uneasy till he came back."

"And did he report himself to Miss Vanderdecken?" I
asked.

"How? Oh yes. She had a long talk with him -- or, 
properly speaking, she sat and listened to him for a good 
half-hour -- and, in the course of conversation, he said all hands
was fishing, and Mr Rigby was spinning yarns that a person
would go through fire and water to hear." (There was
an envious inflection in the woman's voice as she spoke
the last words; then she proceeded in her usual tone.)
"Well, after that, she went to her room, and Miss
Flanagan with her, and I never seen her again till this
morning. She come from the same place as you, Mr Rigby
 -- didn't she?"<pb n="245"/>

"Yes," replied the Senator, absently.

"I thought so. She told me, in the course of conversation,
that she knew a lot of people that you knew. I'm sorry
you didn't see her again. Well, you must excuse me; this is
one of my busy days."

"Tom," muttered the Deacon, as we passed through to
the bar, "can you suggest any form of penance that would
meet the merits of this case?"

"I can. Will you follow my advice?"

"I'll follow anybody's advice, now -- even yours."

"Then leave your wagonette in charge of these people,
and borrow Steve's horse for a day or two. That's all
practicable. Follow Miss Vanderdecken to Echuca; you'll
be there almost as soon as she is. Apologise to her; grovel, if
necessary, for I'm afraid that, in the face of Sam's evidence,
nothing but the truth will serve. Still, you can tell that
truth in such a way as to leave the impression that your
default was in some way owing to a certain greatness of
soul, inscrutable to the girl mind. Wait on the ladies for a
couple of days; show them the lions; exchange 
reminiscences; compare conclusions; -- in a word, quit yourself
valiantly, and let the Lord do as seemeth Him good."

"Not to be thought of, Tom," murmured the 
Commodore aside to me, for iVIaginnis was in the bar, and Fritz
was entering. "How could I force myself upon her, after
what has happened? I must just let the wretchedness and
infamy of the transaction (Good morning, Fritz) die out
by the process of the suns. And a hopeless prospect that is,
for if there's a man alive whose whole moral being is one
comprehensive register of foregone sensation (What'll you
try this morning, Tom?), that man is myself. Constant as the
northern star, of whose true-fixed (What's yours, Fritz?)
and moveless quality there is no fellow in the firmament.
The penalties of this irrational and involuntary fidelity of
mine (I'll take a cigar, this time, Jimmy) transcend its
advantages by a very long way. (Pass the jug, please, Jimmy,
and an empty glass. Here's to the good time coming, boys
 -- in honest water, that never left man in the mire)."
<pb n="247"/>

"Y'ou goot helt, yentlemence," interposed Fritz, raising
his tankard. "Peer vor der Yarmance, unt Yarmany vor der
peer. Minezelluf, I schall pe ver podiclo mit mine trinks.
Ven der Yarmance knog (sheol) der French mit dot last
var --"

"Don't imagine that my solicitude is for yourself,
Colonel," said I, when we had left the bar and turned
toward the river. "I'm thinking of Miss Vanderdecken --

- {:.indent-3}Must she too bend, must she too share
- {:.indent-3}Thy late repentence, long despair,
- {:.indent-4}Thou throneless homicide?
{:.poetry}

I'd rather than anything you would take my advice. You're
pledged to do so, remember. I never was more serious in my
life."

The General shook his head. "Is there any use in asking
you to stand off and contemplate the position you want
to place me in?" he asked wearily. "Don't you see that we
must view this thing from Miss Vanderdecken's 
stand-point, not from ours? Don't you see that she is judge, jury,
and prosecutor in the case; that the case is closed, and
cannot be re-opened, except for exonerative evidence; and
will you tell me where such evidence is to come from?
What use is there in my approaching her as a penitent,
when she must of necessity view me as an interested 
hanger-on? Be sure she has taken my measure; and though she
has, perhaps, taken it wrongly, I have lost the right to
protest. Why, she would very probably consider herself
justified in asking me how much I would take to let our
acquaintance drop. Granting that I deserve her contempt,
why should I invite a further instalment of it? Not for her
sake, surely; and, though I leave myself out of the question,
not for my own sake either. Your estimate of the whole
matter is warped, I am happy to think, by friendship; and,
besides, she is the aggrieved party, not you. For my own
part, I have lost a friend, possibly a co-operator -- and
heaven knows that is a loss which taxes my patience. By
the way, do you know that boy's name? Sam what?"<pb n="248"/>

"Ferneyhurst," I replied, after a moment's considera-
tion. "Sam Ferneyhurst. You'll hear of him at the ----
Hotel, Echuca." (And the boy's name did turn out to be
Brackenridge. A nut for your nomenological sceptics to
crack.) "That's where you'll find Miss Vanderdecken. I'll
never speak to you again if you don't take my advice."

But the Deacon was obdurate. Returning to the camp,
we found Dixon plaiting a whip, and Lushington sitting
beside him on one of the oil-drums used for carrying water
on the roads. The clergyman, finding that Smith had 
forgotten his appointment, was turning his attention to the
somewhat urgent case of Dixon, and with a meed of success,
for the bullock driver, won from his up-country reticence
by Lushington's genuine sympathy, was now giving his
own spiritual experience with childlike frankness and
vivacity, though in language too manly for reproduction
here. Altogether, the honest fellow expected to get to
heaven in the end, though he would be content to shave
every post on the course; nevertheless he had hopes that
the fire and brimstone of the other place were in the nature
of a *brutum* (adj.) *fulmen*. There was nothing novel or
interesting in this, so I caught my horses, and, refusing to
shake hands with the Major, went on my way.<pb n="249"/>

## CHAPTER XLVII


- Spare her, I pray thee! If the maid is sleeping,

- No more! She leaves her memory in thy keeping.
- {:.indent-6}O. W. Holmes, *Iris, Her Book*.

If any reader of romantic temperament should share my
own strong personal interest in the further fortunes of Miss
Vanderdecken, I shall be much pleased to lay before her
the only scrap of information I possess. But I must warn
her (the reader, of course, not Miss V.) that I have only
one style of narrative -- take it or leave it.

Towards three o'clock on a Saturday afternoon, six or
eight weeks after the date of the events just recorded, a
swagman rode slowly past the Deniliquin football ground,
where a crowd numbering (to speak circumspectly) five
or six hundred bodies indicated a coming event of some
local importance -- no less, indeed, than the first match of
the season. Actual interest in the game was yet abeyant,
and the organisms were collected in idle groups, pending
the inaugural bouncing of the ball.

The swagman jogged along, his mental upper-current
noting the assemblage, the weather, with other accessories
of the scene, and meanwhile construing the pace of his
horse into the different distances of three several paddocks,
each available for duffing. But your swaggie, as well as
yourself, has two separate personalities; and this man's
second-self, as represented by his mental under-current,
was lapt in higher, thoughts -- though, to be sure, these were
not rigorously devotional, for he had sixteen shillings in
his pocket. In fact, he was composing a sonnet to the 
evening star.<pb n="250"/>

The bay mare, with her equipment, had cost forty-five
shillings at the saleyard in Hay, and was not likely to fetch
a higher price in Echuca. She was a broken-down racer,
blind of one eye; and the saddle and bridle kept her in
countenance. A partially-obliterated map of dried blue
clay, covering her near ribs and shoulder, also extended
over the rider's left side from boot to ear, indicated that
she had been down somewhere in the saltbush country;
whilst a corresponding patch of wet mud on the near side,
and somewhat sandy in quality, betokened a spill of more
recent date. But her philosophic master was one who
accepted the Spanish proverb that "it is better to ride a goat
than to walk".

Close at the heels of the mare came a large, slate-colored
kangaroo dog, perfect in every point, yet not too fine. And
it is worthy of remark -- though by no means remarkable -- 
that the football crowd scrutinised the dog with hungry
interest, and viewed the mare with a sympathetic regard,
whilst overlooking the traveller himself as a bloke of no
account.

With one exception. As the swagman came abreast, a
well-grown boy advanced from the crowd. He was clad in
an ulster made for some man of seven feet high, which
garment, thrown open in front, disclosed the scanty uniform
of Echuca Juniors. The mare stopped spontaneously. The
lad laid one hand on her mane, and, with grave cordiality,
extended the other to her rider.

"How are you poppin' up, Collins? I s'pose you was a
bit cut up at bein' disappointed o' seein' me that mornin'?"

"Well, I *did* feel it," I replied, as I scanned the 
self-possessed but ingenuous face, and mentally reviewed the
past few years, trying vainly to establish a connection.

"Same here. But I reckoned you'd hear the rights of it
from the Maginnises. Say, I had an idear you was goin'
up for a mob o' cattle. Contract tumbled through some
road, seemin'ly?"

"Well, yes. In a certain sense the thing was a failure.
Where's Miss Vanderdecken now?"<pb n="251"/>

"Went back to Melb'n. What's come o' them two black
horses o' yours?"

"Gone."

"Sold?"

"Shook."

"You was tellin' me you had two mates in the 
speculation, how about them?"

"Same box. Similarly cleaned out. Writ with me in sour
misfortune's book."

The boy uttered a low, soft, self-respecting whistle, and
I continued:

"When did Miss Vanderdecken leave Echuca?"

"Let's see, a fortnit after that time. I seen her off. Got
any idear who worked the oracle on you?"

"Two fine, smart, up-to-date chaps; men that knew every
inch of country from here to the Diamantina: Pete Davis
and Dan Scott -- stage names, probably. Spooner picked
them up on his way from Wagga, and secured them for
our trip. Was Miss Vanderdecken in good spirits when
you took her back to Echuca?"

"Miserable as a bandicoot. How'd you manage to let
them fellers git the loan o' you so cheap?"

"I'll explain. According to appointment, I reached Hay
on a certain Sunday, with my own two horses, and two
more from Yarrawonga. Spooner met me on the bridge,
and went with me to where our mate, Rory O'Halloran,
was camped on the Common, a couple of miles from the
town, with these two chaps, and five more horses. We were
to pick up another man, with a horse of his own, at
Booligal. Our plan was to start from Hay first thing in the
morning. Couple of hours before sundown I walked back
to the town to leave Pup in charge of a friend of mine -- 
a man that I knew to be trustworthy and careful. I ought
to have left him with Mrs Ferguson, in Echuca, but I
couldn't bring myself to part with him at the last moment --"

"Better if you'd 'a give him to me when I run across you
that time."

"Economically, yes. As you shall hear. I stayed yarning<pb n="252"/>
with this friend till the middle of the night, and then cleared
for our camp, with a strong dust-storm in my face. Not a
star to be seen for dust, and no moon that night. Not a
spark of fire where I expected to find the camp, but I came
to the conclusion that Spooner and Rory had been dainty
enough to shift somewhere else on account of the wind. So
I lay down, and went asleep with an easy mind. At the
first peep of day I woke up, half-buried in sand, and the
first thing I distinguished forty yards away was a man
shaking the sand out of his ears. It turned out to be Spooner.
He had slipped over to the town just before sunset to have
three more words with a drapery-girl that he has been
engaged to for the last couple of years. She wanted him to
attend Evening Service with her, but he excused himself
on account of his clothes, and so missed the chance of 
balancing for a busy day spent in worldly affairs. A lame 
pretext, too, for the clothes were bran new; and he wasn't in
a position to be independent -- if he had only known it."

"Right. I bin there myself," interposed Sam approvingly.

"At all events, he left the town about nine o'clock; and
from that time his experience had been something like
mine. I don't think either of us had any uncharitable feeling
toward Rory; we knew him to be an average bushman, and
we judged that he had some sufficient reason for shifting
the camp. So we were about setting out to explore the river
timber, when up comes Rory himself, battling against the
wind. He had been groping round after the camp for some
hours, as well as ourselves.

"The fact was that the poor fellow had a little girl
buried in the Hay cemetery, and the thought of the child
had grown upon him as night came on, till he could stand
it no longer -- he had to do something. So, just after dark,
he had gone across to the cemetery, and had sat by the
grave for some hours. Then he spent the rest of the night
wondering why the camp had been shifted.

"What had taken place at the camp in the meantime is
no business of ours, unless we want to be impertinent. It
is a matter that rests solely between Pete and Dan on the<pb n="253"/>
one hand and the Recording Angel on the other. Our only
concern lies in the fact that our whole plant was gone, and
gone in a sand-storm that hadn't left five yards of 
identifiable horse-tracks in the county of Waradgery. But if
there's any sense in the balderdash about foemen worthy
of your steel, we had at least the satisfaction of knowing
that our fugitive antagonists were past masters in geography.
An experience of this kind helps a person to realise the
magnificent extent of Australia. That's all. Did you see
much of Miss Vanderdecken during the time that she
stayed in Echuca?"

"A lot. Where do you think them blokes has got to?"

"Where are the leaves of autumn, Sam? Where is the
lost Pleiad? Where is the boy that stood on the burning
deck? Where is your own lost youth? Did the Colonel get
back to Echuca before Miss Vanderdecken left?"

"No. Just missed her by the skin o' your teeth, as the
sayin' is. Why ain't you follerin' them coves up?"

"That's what I was foolish enough to do for some weeks.
Finally, eight or ten days ago, I met a man riding one of
Spooner's horses, faked to perfection; and this man had
bought the horse from a tank-sinker away back on
Poolkija; and I knew the tank-sinker to be straight. Saw the
receipt and recognised the signature. That was the only
trace I got; and it satisfied me. But I understood you to
say that Miss Vanderdecken stayed in Echuca for a 
fortnight?"

"So she did. Is your mates follerin' them blokes yet?"

"Also I understood from the Major that he would fall
back upon Echuca in a week or so to do some writing-up.
Did he not call on Miss Vanderdecken?"

"He was some days longer'n he expected to be. But I
was askin' you if your mates is follerin' them gallus-birds
up?"

"Well, Rory has gone back to Goolumbulla, in hope of
getting into his old billet again. He has two horses there, to
go on with. The poor fellow came out like a man when we
fell in. The whole speculation had left him nothing less<pb n="254"/>
than a hundred notes out of pocket; but he offered Spooner
and me fifty notes each, to repay our loss and 
disappointment. Of course, we weren't on; but eventually we
accepted a fiver each to help us on the warpath. Spooner's
in chase still, last thing I heard from him. So Miss 
Vanderdecken was gone before the Deacon came?"

"She went away in the mornin', an' he come in the 
afternoon. Think Spooner's got any possible o' collarin' them
coves?"

"Not merely a possible, but a moral. Let him once see
their tracks and he'll overhaul them hand over fist. He
may have them by this time, with whatever plunder they've
got left. Did Miss Vanderdecken know that the General
was coming to Echuca shortly?"

"Dunno. Arty did. I say, Spooner'll give them chaps a
matter o' five years without the option."

"What for?"

"Horse-stealin'."

"They didn't steal the horses. You're sure Miss Flanagan
knew --"

"Illegally in possession, then."

"They're not illegally in possession. Let Spooner alone.
He's as shrewd as he's straight, and that's saying 
something. He has receipts -- witnessed by a police magistrate -- 
for my two horses and Rory's one; and the rest were
bought by himself. If he finds any of them in the possession
of our absent friends he'll just watch his chance, and quietly
reshake them. Then he'll call round in a business-like way
to claim the saddles and things. I think he'll recover them
without difficulty; and if the other fellows are impudent
enough to demand so many weeks' wages, they'll find him
a bit of a lawyer as well as a bit of a bushman. But that's his
business, not ours. You're sure Miss Flanagan knew that
the Senator was coming?"

"Yes, I told her. She used to call at our place of an
evenin' to see me; an' about the fust time she was there she
says, 'Wonder when Mr Rigby's comin' to Echucar, or if
he's comin' this road at all?' An' it happened to be that<pb n="255"/>
when the Colonel was goin' fishin' that night, after he'd
been yarnin' with Miss Vanderdecken, I heard him tellin'
Maginnis he'd be goin' to Echucar in a week for good.
Course he didn't git there for another week. Great ole
preachin' we had that night down at the river. Mind you,
there's a lot in it. Things is drawin' towards a change, an'
us Socialists is no more responsible for the comin' 
revolution than the petrel is for the storm it prognosticates. Mere
matter of evolution. A hundred years ago we thought all
we wanted was a fair field an' no favor, on a gospel
accordin' to poor Richard; but now we find that sort o'
thing means the survival of the greediest. Restraint's the
thing we want now, considerin' that the old order gits
shunted, makin' room for the new, for fear o' one good
system blue-mouldin' the world; an' God fulfils Himself in
lots o' ways. Mind you, Individualism would suit *me* all to
pieces. I'd strip for the spin from Log Cabin to White
House, figuratively speakin', without givin' a beggar how
good the company was; but I'm thinkin' about the fellers
that can't run for sour muck, no odds what dons they are
other ways. Jist so in social-economics. An' it's no use
sayin' the dominant classes ought to do this, an' ought to
do that. 'Ought' be dash, they *won't* do it. But it'll be did,
all the same. *They* tell you inventions an' science an' all
manner o' labor-savin' things ain't goin' to stan' still for the
sake o' the workin' class. 'Right,' says we, 'Excelsior's the
watchword of science at large,' says we. Social-economic is
quite as much as physical, an' social-economics ain't goin'
to stan' still for the sake o' the sharkin' class. Same time,
we ain't ready yet. We ain't schooled. As Gronlund says
 -- or I wouldn't be sure but what it's the prophet Hosear -- 
'My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.' But how
long'll it take to break the galoots in? Couple or three
generations, says you? Well, it'll take about ten years, at
the outside. You'll edicate a man up to it in two years -- if
he ain't a fat-head altogether -- an' it don't take any longer
to edicate a million head o' fellers nor one straggler. See,
I'm allowin' eight years to come an' go on. Fust, the poet<pb n="256"/>
an' the sage has got to enlighten the people; then the
statesman's got to organise the national policy; then, you
see, we got the man with the rifle -- an' that's the beggar we
want. We want to sling the onus of rebellion on the
monopolist. Course *he* says 'Hold on, I stand out.' 'No, I'm
dashed if you do,' says we; 'fall into line quick, or by gosh
we'll straighten you.' As Pompey said to the Mamertines,
'Why will you prate of privileges to men with swords in
their hands?' Makes me laugh."

It didn't make me laugh. Insanity is rampant in our
family, and I was feebly wondering what the premonitory
hallucinations were generally like, when a wholesomer idea
struck me.

"Have you been talking to the Colonel during the last
few weeks, Sam?" I asked.

"Stacks o' times. Me an' him's like brothers. Gosh, ain't
he a man of a thousand. *He* didn't come down with the
las' rain. Pity that sort o' bloke ever dies. I'd give a trifle
to be like him -- though I ain't half rotten when I throw my
ears back. No loss o' time with me now, I promise you.
When I ain't readin' or argyin', my thinkin' tackle's goin'
like fury. I'm doin' my level. Course, I belong to the club,
for the sake o' gittin' in touch with fellars that's got their
brains lower down. Anyhow, athletics is no objection to
study, s'posin you don't gamble. Poor heart that never
rejoices. Greatest athletics in the world was the classic
Greeks, an' in Plato's *Republic* you'll fine -- "

"How did Miss Vanderdecken pass the time away while
she stayed in Echuca?" I asked uneasily, feeling as the
simple-minded reader would feel if she heard, or fancied
she heard, some baby of a fortnight old asking for his pipe
and tobacco.

"On'y seen her a couple or three times for the fust week,
though I often seen Arty. After that -- me bein' out o' work
waitin' for a new feller to start in the shop -- Arty used to
git me to hire a horse an' buggy every afternoon, an' take
the two o' them for a bit of a drive up the river road,
where you an' us begun to overtake one another -- if you<pb n="257"/>
remember. I say, why didn't you snap Miss Vanderdecken?
She was fair collared on you that afternoon. I could see it
stickin' out a mile, simple as I gammoned to be."

"She knew the Major in the Old Country, didn't she?"
I conjectured.

"Noddin' acquaintance, likely. Gosh, ain't he a daisy?
Knows everything, dash near. Sort o' bloke I'll be when
I git fairly goin'. I say, we must go into the social-economic
subject properly when we get a slant, an' you'll fine I can
give you a couple or three wrinkles. I'll introduce you to a
swag o' fellers o' my way o' thinkin', an' you'll see I'm
the daddy o' the ridgement. Strikes me, my little star ain't a
bit too st--nkin', is she? Used to wish I was an ole bloke,
but now I'm glad I got so much in front o' me. I'll jist be
in the thick of it -- won't I? Great! As Paine says, 'If there
be war, let it be in my time, that my children may have
peace.' That's my idear, too. I'm thinkin' about'my kids.
Different from Hezekiar -- that ole cocktail says: 'Good is
the word that the Lord hath spoken, for there shall be
peace in my time' -- knowin', mind you, that his kids was
going to drop in for it hot. Well, them times is past now;
swallered up in the evolution of humanity. Thanks first to
Gutenberg, an' then to the long line o' prophets, from
Rousseau to Bellamy, there is at last a Daniel for every
Writing on the Wall; a Curtius for every yawning chasm;
a What-you-may-call-'im for every --"

"Did the Deacon seem to take much interest in hearing
about Miss Vanderdecken?" I interposed hastily, for I
wanted to hear my own voice.

"Well, yes; even if it did seem to make him sort o' 
melancholy. But I say -- onna bright -- you look's if you was gone
on her? Can't blame you -- fact, I give you credit. She's a
ding-donger. Bin along that track myself. Same time, Arty's
more my style. Natural enough, considerin' she's the dead
spit o' my missus, though, of course, my missus is a lot
younger."

"Who did you say was a lot younger?" I asked, with
renewed disquietude of mind.<pb n="258"/>

"My missus -- my wife."

"What is this for?" I murmured reproachfully, with an
upward glance.

"Eh?"

"Nothing, Sam."

"Want o' sleep, an' general worry; that's what's shakin'
you up, Collins. Ain't surprisin' considerin'. Take a couple
o' days' spell at our place when you git to Echucar. We got
a spare room. Goin' fur down into Vic?"

"Uncertain. I'll know better when I get to Echuca."

"Anythin' up your sleeve, so to speak?"

"Well, yes. Just when I met you at Maginnis's the
Colonel had been refused a billet on account of his jossless
irreverence toward our institutions, and I've made 
application for a cut-in at the same sphere of usefulness. I stand a
good show, if there's a vacancy."

"Yes; the General was tellin' me about the sort o' jar he
got, that time. S'pose you've took degrees in string binders,
before today?"

"Haven't been privileged to see one of them yet, though
I spent some of my earlier years among machinery, and not
without a share of reputation. But I have higher 
qualifications than mere skill. I belong to a powerful clan, strong in
two electorates, and we're well known to be 
constitutionally sound on the one thing needful."

"Handy thing to have in the fam'ly, s'posin' it don't blind
a feller to the social-economic question," replied Sam
gravely. "Anyhow, you jist go straight to our place when
you git to Echucar. Expect the Major'll be in tomorrow, if
it ain't rainin'. He's takin' levels for the irrigation racket
these times. An' what d'you think -- we got Furlong swore
in. The Colonel rounded him up. Grand little chap, but he's
got notions. Don't do to be a feller of one book, no matter
if that book's the Bible. Course, the Major goes in strong for
Scripture, too; but he ain't spiritually-minded. No more
ain't I. Mind, all of us gives Furlong credit for his religion,
considerin' his heart's in the right place --"

Here a long, shrill whistle sounded from the crowd. Sam,<pb n="259"/>
too dignified to look round, stuck two fingers in his mouth,
and replied in kind.

"Central umpire," he remarked indifferently. "S'pose I
must go an' have a welt at this bag o' wind. I'm goal-sneak.
Wish you could stop an' barrack for us, but considerin' the
track's a bit greasy, I think you better be shovin' along.
Now mind you don't forget to head straight for our place.
Missus'll be glad to see you, for I told her you was a cove
worth takin' by the hand. Mrs Ferguson'll tell you where
we live. So long."

And the petrel of State Socialism towed the tail of his
ulster toward the arena, whilst I resumed my way, reflecting
on the unsatisfactory issue of a romance which at one time
had seemed to contain all the elements of happiness.

- {:.indent-1}T' undo the Past, and eke your broken years."

But, after all, what is happiness? "Felicity" is its closest
synonym, and you will observe that both words have the
alternative import of Compatibility, or Accordance -- as
when we speak of "a happy combination", "a felicitous
phrase", and so forth. Such a coincidence in 
double-meaning is not without significance, since it betokens an 
instructive sub-consciousness that Happiness must not be 
incongruous, or out of place, in respect of the Universal Harmony.
Doubtless, our field of thought is invaded by a prophetic
forecast, a twilight revelation of completer life, not directly
formulated, though finding cryptic register in everyday
speech. Then -- taking Happiness in the double-intent of the
word -- who shall presume to interpret its manifestation, or
limit its scope? Passing over the vanishing happiness of the
moment, the ephemeral happiness of the day, and the scarcely
less transitory happiness of the lifetime, may not the
Ultimate Happiness of the Moral Universe be in some way
consistent with the cross-purposes of human life? Further,
may not this Final Felicity (whatever the term may imply)
be directly subserved by what appears to our myopic
scrutiny as untrammelled thought wedded to marionette
action; as painful heart-thrift mocked by prodigal waste; as
poetic augury refuted by prosaic anti-climax? And if there
be a Universal Purpose, beyond individual welfare, and
apart from the wayside interests of existence -- if each 
lifetime be but one pace of Humanity in a decreed journey<pb n="261"/>
toward some Ultimate Good -- then, measuring the 
consummation by its incalculable cost, that Good may be taken
as the Inconceivable Best.

Ay, but -- mortal men, Hal, mortal men. And women still
more inveterately mortal. Mortality is here emphasised, not
in trite confession of its precarious tenure, but because of its
abject servility to terrestrial conditions. The brain which
explores the arcana of Science, or seeks new horizons in
Thought, is apt to ache consumedly. We are not such stuff as
dreams are made on, but precisely the reverse. In fact, the
avoirdupois will assert itself, carrying not only its physical
vulgarities, but also those emotional attributes inwoven with
its texture. The gravitation which anchors human feet to
the earth has its analogue in the super-physical province of
life, where (to speak frankly) the Indeterminate is just one
step beyond the Empirical. Setting aside the "illative sense"
as unscientific, we have within easy reach, here and now, the
line where Verification ends and Conjecture begins. For in
no terms of experiment, in no formula known to research
can the authentic story of an extra-mundane Scheme of Life
be told. There was a Door to which Omar Khayyam found
no Key; there was a Veil past which he could not see. To
sane minds, the Universal Plan is the enigma of the ages;
detached, objective, and wholly intangible -- any attempt at
solution thus being a capricious speculation, shaped by the
proclivities or by the experience of its projector, and 
varying even with his mood.

But current Emotion -- of the earth, though by no means
earthy -- is a matter of certainty, not of supposition. Here, at
least, we have, comprehended within the secularised Ego,
a radical incentive which governs its own containing 
individuality as magnetism governs the compass-needle.
Hence, for instance, the maid called Barbara was left with
nothing but her song of "Willow", and she died singing it.
What availed the Scheme of Life to her? -- though she held
debentures therein, equal in face value to yours, or mine, or
Kate Vanderdecken's. Invite her to "eliminate the <pb n="262"/>
hedonistic calculus". Why, the words would die on your lips, in
pure shame of their cruel falsity.

Romeo also found that Philosophy could not make a
Juliet. And so it fared, to a considerable extent, even with
the self-sufficient Colonel. That incident marked an epoch
in his thought-life. The old record, sweet, tender, exclusive;
the Eden-song, written in rose and gold, now reappeared on
the palimpsest of Memory, never again to be obliterated;
and from that time forth an accession of sadness was
observable in his bearing, with an abatement of the cynicism
which had lent a kind of fascination to his homilies. Despite
his habitual reticence, all this was evident to me.

But each nature is tripartite in super-physical faculty, and
the influence of that echo from the past, however potent
emotionally, had no curative effect on the Major's mental
and moral elements. What can arrest the momentum, or
disturb the bias of half a lifetime? When the Ego has ceased
to be a hobby-ridden man, and has culminated into a 
man-escorted hobby, there is no hope of restoration. A sky-pilot
of large experience once told me that he had never known a
man of fifty to ask, "What must I do to be saved?" and my
own observation of seasoned iniquity goes to confirm the
melancholy avowal. Nevertheless, forbear to judge, for we
are sinners all.

Meanwhile, Kate Vanderdecken has seemed to me as one
who paused a moment, tremulous yet trustful, on this great
stage of fools; then passed out into the lonely night, her
myrtle wreath purple-flecked with martyrs' amaranth.

Let us say, with Whittier --

- God pity them both! and pity us all,
- {:.indent-1}Who vainly the dreams of youth recall.
- For of all sad words of tongue or pen,
- {:.indent-1}The saddest are these: "It might have been."
- Ah well! for us all some sweet hope lies
- {:.indent-1}Deeply-buried from human eyes;
- And, in the Hereafter, angels may
- {:.indent-1}Roll the stone from its grave away!
{:.poetry}
